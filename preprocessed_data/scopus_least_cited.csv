"Postcolonial ecocriticism: A study of “development” in arundhati roy’s “the greater common good”","2019","IUP Journal of English Studies","0","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85120005049&partnerID=40&md5=444668906f726b45e7b9e8307e27e45b","Postcolonial literature, also called “protest literature,” demands social justice for the atrocities committed against the natives, but not much attention has been paid to the atrocities against the indigenous environment. Postcolonial studies has mostly been anthropocentric. However, the destruction of the environment during the colonial period needs to be addressed, as human beings and nature are interdependent. The colonial rulers regarded any unused natural resource to be unproductive, and in order to make it “productive,” the native environment was either wiped out altogether or vastly restructured to suit their purpose of economic benefits. The restructuring of the natural environment affected the indigenous people because they lost not only their roots and culture but also their traditional livelihood. This vast restructuring of nature has been justified on the grounds of “development,” but this development has always been an uneven one from a materialistic point of view because in this development, only the most powerful in the hierarchy of power have benefited, whereas, the colonized—the poor, the natives—have always been exploited. This paper delves into the issue of “development” in the postcolonial context with reference to the essay “The Greater Common Good” by postcoloni al writer-activist, Arundhati Roy. © 2019 IUP.All Rights Reserved."

In our potentially dangerous times, the instrumental, technical and fragmented ways of seeing knowledge tend to permeate most disciplines, including medicine. This may result in individuals becoming alienated with the 'self' as potential doctors, with the discipline and with patients through the monologic discourse of academia or clinics. This article examines this (in)visible global issue in the specific context of Iran, where bilingual medical education adds another level of complexity in dialogic 'seeing' of self, knowledge and patients. Grounded in Bakhtin's theory of dialogue and critical literacy approach to language and literacy, this article explores the affordances of a pedagogical intervention at an Iranian university. This offers diverse avenues for constructing a holistic medical knowledge in the process of becoming a professional through narrative medicine, clinical scenarios, evidence-based medicine and personal experiences. Selected stories of participants' ontological and epistemological transformations, in their process of ideological becoming, are offered to argue for the urgency of dialogic ways of 'seeing' in potentially dangerous times. © MAHTAB JANFADA, 2020"

On the basis of the expansion with respect to the affine coordinate, it is shown that some inner products compose Bregman divergence. Since the centroids are determined in two ways, depending on coordinate used for centering, Bregman information is also evaluated in two ways. In both cases, Bregman information is shown to be represented as a weighted sum of the eigenvalues of two inner product matrices. For given dissimilarities, the problem which finds the values of the inner product matrices is described as a semidefinite programming. As an example, numerical calculations are also presented. © 2019, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd."

(2019) address a critical issue in cognitive science—defining scientific practices that will promote rigor and confidence in our science by ensuring that our mechanisms, models, and theories are adequately described and validated to facilitate replication and to foster trust. They provide a number of concrete suggestions to advance our science along that path. The recommendations emphasize preregistration of models and predictions combined with more comprehensive model evaluation, including published descriptions of exploratory analyses, alternative mechanisms, and model assumptions. These are excellent recommendations, and general adoption of such practices will benefit model assessment and validation methodologies in cognitive science research while improving trust in published reports of computational and mathematical accounts of cognitive phenomena. However, it is unclear that these strategies alone will resolve many other important challenges faced in developing quantitative theories of human cognition and behavior. For example, addressing the crisis of confidence will not, by itself, move the science toward the broader goal of developing more comprehensive and cumulative theories of the nature of the human mind. Cognitive modeling is a critical methodology for achieving that goal. However, to realize the potential will require changes not only to how we evaluate our models, but also to how we measure progress and scientific contribution. © 2019, This is a U.S. government work and not under copyright protection in the U.S.; foreign copyright protection may apply."

This procedure directly tests researchers’ ability to make valid conclusions about underlying processes based on data patterns and assesses the extent to which they accurately report the level of uncertainty associated with their research conclusions. As such, blinded inference studies are a valuable tool in the effort to improve research practices. In this comment, we review three recent studies in the cognitive modeling literature to highlight the benefits of blinded inference, and we make recommendations for future blinded inference studies.

This study sought to assess the apolipoprotein A in cohort of patients diagnosed with early onset acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction and to corelate it with major traditional cardiovascular risk factors. Methods A total of 50 such patients and 40 age and sex-matched healthy controls, both aged less than 50 years with their baseline demographic, clinical characteristics and cardiovascular risk factors were studied. Apolipoprotein A was estimated for all enrollees. Results The mean age of cases was 43.37 ± 5.85 years. The levels of apolipoprotein A among cases were not significantly lower compared to controls (P = 0.52). They were lower among the male, current smokers and the dyslipidemia (P's < 0.05). Considering the apolipoprotein A as the dependent factor, the early onset ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction was associated significantly with the male and the dyslipidemia in linear regression (P < 0.001 and 0.030), respectively. Conclusion Lower levels of apolipoprotein A are significantly related to conventional risk factors in early onset ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. This apolipoprotein A that particularly develops in young patients with clustering of traditional cardiovascular risk factors should be targeted. Further studies are warranted to determine the diagnostic and prognostic indicators of this apolipoprotein in ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction.  © 2019 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc."

With their profound urban setting and traditional cityscape, the architectural remnants of the Walled City of Lahore depict one of the most remarkable urban centers of their era. The huge public migration of local residents away from the area in 1947 was followed by an influx of new residents who had no affiliation with the historical built environment. Based on a literature review, the authors derived 10 parameters to study whether the resulting transformations retained the area’s heritage. The resulting report on the temporal changes to land use, the built environment, and the architecture of the walled city was not encouraging. To determine the reasons for the decaying historical urban fabric, the authors sought data and feedback from interviews with local residents and representatives of the Walled City of Lahore Authority. The main finding of the study suggested that the Walled City of Lahore Authority adopted a project-based approach to conservation instead of an integrated process. The study provides suggestions for a way forward to develop a process-oriented system that would consequently lead to the conservation of the walled city. © 2019, Locke Science Publishing Company, Inc."

The main questions are how the researcher gains access to the “flirtation field,” which flirting roles the youth participants engage in, and how the researcher copes with flirtation in the field. The article’s theoretical approach draws on feminist methodology on how positions, roles, and relations are negotiated in fieldwork, and discusses the notion of erotic capital. Christian festivals in Norway attract among 100,000 people every year. One of the main activities that was brought to my attention by a car trailer was the importance of flirting between the young boys and girls at these festivals. At the Christian festivals, flirting takes place within a heterosexual framework. In order to be part of this game, the girls are supposed to be feminine and available. The boy’s role is to be active and take initiative. Both sexes work hard to become participants in this game of winning attention that represents two different worlds for boys and girls, and in which there are both male and female losers. The rules of the game seem doubly strict for the girls since they are expected to administer both their own and the boys’ lust. © 2019 by the author. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland."

These symmetries are studied on a three dimensional space-like hypersurface embedded in a four-dimensional space–time manifold. This implies continuous symmetries and conserved currents by Noether’s theorem on that surface. We construct a three-form (D represents covariant exterior derivative) in the phase space on the surface, and derive an equation of continuity on that surface, and search for canonical relations and a Lagrangian that correspond to the same equation of continuity according to the canonical field theory.

An innovative thermal imaging solution for glass furnace applications using a Near Infrared Borescope provides a true-temperature radiometric image, so live temperature values can be obtained from >324,000 pixels and provides continuous coverage 24/7. The solution allows long term data trending for fuel optimization plus enables thermal optical profiles to be measured continuously and specifically during furnace reversal. Example case study shows how a leading container glass manufacturer has used this infrared temperature measurement solution to highlight issues within a glass melt tank, enable them to make necessary repairs and then optimize firing to achieve new record pull rates on an asset nearing the end of its campaign. Alarms and temperature isotherms also provide the manufacturer with long-term asset protection against over-heating and condensation zones. On the firing side, clear correlations have been identified between apparent flame temperatures and corresponding NOx, allowing these findings to be used potentially as part of emission and de-NOx reduction programmes. © 2019, Society of Glass Technology.

The theorem states that among all central forces, the only two in which bound orbits are also closed orbits are the harmonic force and inverse-square force. As existing proofs of the theorem require advanced mathematics, this paper presents a much more simplistic proof of Bertrand's theorem without having to solve any complicated integrals or using mathematical tools beyond the scope of high school curriculum. The first part of the proof shows that the radial force must be a single power law, and the second part of the proof - which is the main crux of this paper - uses the fact that the radial distance of the motion must be a power of a sinusoidal function of the polar angle in nature. With a simple mathematical manipulation, the proof is then completed. This derivation is expected to be of great interest to high school teachers and students as it enhances the understanding of this distinct feature of inverse square force and harmonic force. © 2019 World Scientific Publishing Company."

BE ultimately progresses to esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC). The aim of this study was to confirm the molecular effects of tobacco smoke and bile reflux in the molecular carcinogenesis of Barrett's adenocarcinoma. Methods: Tobacco smoke condensate (4,000 ng/mL and dilutions) and a standardized bile acid (0.4 mM) were used to determine effects on a human hTERT-immortalized non-neoplastic Barrett's esophageal cell line (BarT) and a human esophageal squamous cell line (Het-1a). Fourteen clinically relevant genes were evaluated via relative quantification real-time PCR analysis. Results: There was a synergistic relationship regarding the effects of bile acids and smoke condensate on both the BarT and Het-1a cell lines. Genes for inflammatory mediators COX2, IL1β, IL6, and IL8 were significantly up-regulated by combination smoke and bile treatment in both cell lines, while genes vital for cellular protection such as superoxide dismutase genes, MUC family of genes, CDX2 and CYP3A4 had varying expression changes. Conclusions: Tobacco smoke may enhance harmful effects of bile-acid refluxate on esophageal mucosa and is a significant factor in EAC carcinogenesis.  © 2021 Annals of Esophagus."

Triangulation methodology was applied. Seventeen participants were included in the qualitative phase of the research carried out in 2011 while the sample in the quantitative phase of the research in 2018 comprised 159 participants. The first phase collected data using the case study and interview, while a questionnaire-Assessment models and methods-was developed for the second phase. The research did not show significant differences in opinions between teachers regarding the same assessment methods seven years later. The results show that teachers in alternative schools give a more positive estimate of the possibility and need for implementation.

Current evaluation and treatment paradigms lack rigorous clinical trial data to support their broad application. The recently released Global Vascular Guidelines (GVG) are an overhaul of the conceptualization of CLI. We aim to introduce readers to the important new concepts emanating from these guidelines. The GVG will provide clinicians with a framework for treatment and evaluation, and will provide clinical trialists with systems of classification to aid in the design and execution of future clinical trials involving CLI. Methods: We review the GVG for the evaluation and treatment of patients with CLI. Results: The GVG offer several novel concepts surrounding evaluation of the patient with CLI, as well as offer guidance on potential revascularization strategies for different clinical and anatomic scenarios. Conclusions: The GVG are an importance advance in field of CLI. Ongoing clinical trials will help to validate or refute the hypotheses put forth in the latest guideline document. © 2019 HMP Communications. All rights reserved."

This single-site, observational, diagnostic accuracy study aimed to quantify medication discrepancies in transition of care from primary care to the emergency department (ED) over a 12-month period. Medication lists in General Practitioner (GP) referrals to a regional ED were examined against a Best Possible Medication History (BPMH) performed by a hospital pharmacist. One hundred and forty-three patients (25%) with computer-generated GP referrals to ED who were subsequently admitted to hospital had a BPMH taken; 135 (94%) of these had at least one medication discrepancy identified with a discrepancy rate of 67.18 discrepancies per 100 medications. Improving medication reconciliation in the community may reduce the burden associated with preventable medication errors. Whether this is achieved by more frequent GP-led medication review or community-based pharmacist medication review may depend on the community and available resources. © 2019 by the authors.

NATO and Russia have defined their roles in world politics, decoded the other's intentions, and undertaken certain practices on the basis of divergent socio-cognitive assumptions. Incompatible strategic cultures bring about clashing grand strategies and generate conflictual relations. The two actors think differently and therefore read and react to a same situation in divergent ways. As a product of socially-embedded dynamics, NATO-Russia enmity cannot be easily overcome - if not in the long term and via sustained interaction. After presenting their theoretical framework, the authors reconstruct NATO's and Russia's strategic cultures, and then discuss the Ukraine crisis as a case study. © 2019 Author. All Rights Reserved."

The concept of ”vulnerable” is, therefore, discussed considering how it was produced by a legal instrument and how it was reproduced by a local institution, what were the consequences for the subjects involved in this research and also for the vulnerable ethnographer. This investigation was based on several months of intense fieldwork where different ethnographic methodologies were employed in order to grasp the complexities of vulnerability and good intentions, such as participants’ observations and semi-directive interviews.

However, OSA has also been suggested to have effects on the lower airway. This study examined the association between pulmonary function test (PFT) results during daytime and OSA according to the severity of OSA and presence of obesity. Changes in PFT results with body position (sitting vs. supine) were also analyzed. Methods: A total of 46 patients who were diagnosed with OSA were included in this study. Patients were grouped according to the severity of OSA and presence of obesity. Results: Obese, severe OSA patients tended to show poorer pulmonary function than non-obese, mild-to-moderate OSA patients. Forced expiratory volume in 1 second/forced vital capacity (FEV1/FVC; sitting), peak expiratory flow (PEF; sitting), and forced expiratory flow during the middle half of the FVC (FEF25-75; supine) were significantly lower in the severe OSA group than the mild-to-moderate OSA group (p=0.020, p=0.044, and p=0.042, respectively). Positional change from sitting to the supine position significantly reduced pulmonary function in the total OSA patient population. The effect of body position on PFT results was greater in non-obese, mild-to-moderate OSA patients. FEF25-75 in the sitting position was still significantly related to the apnea-hypopnea index in OSA patients after adjusting for other factors (p=0.048). Conclusion: This study indicated that relationships exist between lower airway function, body position, and OSA. The PFT is a simple test that can provide useful information about the upper and lower airways in OSA patients. Copyright © 2019 Korean Academy of Sleep Medicine"

These limitations can be overcome through optimal design and the acquisition of knowledge regarding which type of green roof is the most efficient and productive based on the climate, type of plants, and technical specifications of the building. Green roofs can help reduce the negative impacts of urbanization if the optimal parameters are used.

In the first, transactions were conducted in currency money (metallic and non-metallic) consisting of fresh imports and pre-existing stocks. In the second, payments were deferred to pre-fixed dates using credit instruments. The circles of cash and credit grew in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, possibly more in the latter. This paper is about a unique professional group, the ṣarrāfs, whose members engaged themselves in both these circles. They were essentially assayers and moneychangers who operated in the market or worked for a client (state, village community, members of the ruling class, merchants), or carried out both functions at the same time. The possession and handling of cash enabled them to diversify their operations, the most important being banking. As bankers, the ṣarrāfs accepted deposits on interest, gave commercial and consumption loans, and transferred money from one place or person to another through bills of exchange (hundī) and book entries (giro). The ṣarrāfs facilitated the movement of money and merchandise also by covering risks on payment of premium (inland, marine and credit insurance). © 2019 Aligarh Historians Society."

The analysis contextualizes conditions of production from concept to post-production. Evidence is that filmmaking choices are framed as much by the aesthetics of filmmaking as by the resources that are available. Filmmaking and distribution occur mostly under the radar. The videofilmmaker is a hybrid between a ""guerilla"" and a ""hustler"" who has adapted his/her means to create a ""shoe-string"" alternative cinematic practice. The paper analyses popular Zimbabwean videofilms, examining the processes of production, interacting with the filmmakers and attempting to understand how they organize themselves in order to come out with low budget productions. In short, from the thematic and cinematographic imperfections and shortfalls of the Zimbabwe videofilm emerges a recognizable Zimbabwean film ""movement, a style, a way of doing film"", a 'subgenre' worth study and critical appreciation. This is an attempt to find purpose, intention, 'beauty' and method out of that which is ordinarily regarded as jumbled, unrefined, ugly and accidental. The researcher concludes that the lack of funding and institutional support has necessitated the creation of a decentralized and decolonized filmmaking praxis in Zimbabwe. © 2019 Adonis and Abbey Publishers Ltd.

It has been suggested that electron field emission from negatively charged electrodes would precede and initiate such discharge. Heating and evaporation of material upon field emission would cause dense plasma to develop in periods of nanoseconds. High-pressure plasma would expand from the cathode, eventually bridging the gap. Nevertheless, the very reason for the unredictable initial development of discharge events after long periods of reliable operation is still matter of debate. Experience from industrial processes suggests hydrocarbon contamination to degrade the electric stability of high-voltage gaps. While former attempts aimed at explaining high field emission by carbonaceous 2D structures or surface resonance effects, this paper discusses whether 3D structures may grow slowly, until their evaporation in a matter of nanoseconds. Similar to the production of carbon nanotubes, protruding structures might comprise carbon and, in addition, metallic nanoparticles, which would boost production of vapor during their explosion. The hypothesis was tested by scanning electron and energy-dispersive X-ray inspection of two cathodes of medical X-ray tubes, covered with metallic seed nanoparticles, which served as model systems. A third cleaner cathode was inspected for comparison. Although certain suggested conditions of carbon feed, elevated substrate temperature and nanoparticle contamination of the surfaces were met, images showed only a very weak sign of growth of suspicious carbon structures. It seems, therefore, unlikely that CNT-like structures are a major cause of high-voltage breakdown between electrodes of X-ray tubes. © 2019 by the author. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland."

The proposed approach has the advantage of decreasing the problem to the solution of a system of algebraic equations, which may then be solved by any numerical method. In the CTM, the solution is approximated via a truncated Chebyshev series expansion and the Chebyshev polynomials are used as the test function. Based on the proposed technique, sandwich beams with elastically restrained edges under arbitrary non-uniform distributed normal and shear loads can be analyzed. The effectiveness of the CTM is illustrated by comparison of the obtained results for various end supports with those extracted from the ABAQUS software. In each considered cases, the numerical results indicate that the proposed scheme is of high accuracy and is efficient for solving the ordinary differential equations and systems of them. © 2019, The Author(s)."

The Asia–Pacific security order includes three levels: China–US strategic relations, the US-led military alliance system, and multilateral and bilateral security mechanisms. The evolution of the Asia–Pacific security order, with the establishment of diplomatic ties between China and the US as a landmark event, has gone through two historical stages. The first stage was characterized by confrontation and the second stage is characterized by a shift from confrontation to cooperation. The most crucial factor in the second stage is the China–US relationship, the establishment of which has brought 4 decades of peace and stability to the Asia–Pacific region. The China–US relationship has constantly seen disputes, even bitter ones, as well as historical opportunities for cooperation. The two countries are never short of reasons for either confrontation or cooperation. The key to the choice between confrontation and cooperation lies in the hands of the elites of the two countries. Whether the political elites can gain insights and steer the direction of the relationship is decided by their conscious effort, foresight, sensitivity to opportunities, and capacity to shape the strategic environment. © 2020, The Institute of International and Strategic Studies (IISS), Peking University."

Using a modified cyclone area automatic objective recognition algorithm for cyclones, we investigated the patterns of spring cyclone activities affecting Changjiang River-Huaihe River valleys (CHV) of China during the previous 37 years. The results indicated that the algorithm performs well in reproducing the cyclogenesis, movement, and cyclolysis of cyclones in CHV. Three new perspectives were found. (1) Most influential cyclones have relatively short travel distances and lifetimes, and they are typically excluded when conducting synoptic-scale cyclone tracking. (2) The cyclogenesis location of influential cyclones in spring displays multi-source characteristics. In particular, the influential cyclones originated in northern China account for 43% with more marked mobility compared to the locally generated cyclones, although most of their centers do not enter CHV. (3) Multi-center cyclones appear mainly in Da Xingan Mountains which is on the east side of the Mongolian Plateau and over the East China Sea.

Many customers believe that the twice yearly timing of the fairs is inadequate as designers need to look at the season’s textiles as early as possible, and some customers have pressed the organisers of the fairs for an earlier view of the season’s products. The organisers have responded to this pressure by holding small, preliminary events which are aimed at giving buyers an early glimpse of the ranges on offer, and the organisers of Milano Unica have brought forward the events for autumn/winter seasons from September to July. Environmental sustainability was a key topic at the European fabric fairs for the autumn/winter 2020/21 season, and many of the fairs hosted specialist areas dedicated to the topic. There was a diverse variety of environmentally sustainable and socially responsible products on display, and several companies were keen to promote their uses of environmentally sustainable and socially responsible production processes and materials in the manufacture of their fabrics. Such materials included traceable fibres, organic fibres, and fibres derived from recycled waste materials. An important theme for autumn/winter 2020/21 is that of nature, and this was evidenced at the fairs in the widespread use of natural fibres—notably wool. Indeed, the intrinsic properties of natural fibres dictated the handle of fabrics for the season, which were soft but also dense. The natural theme was also evident in colours, and many fabrics incorporated undyed natural fibres in various shades of browns, fawns and greys. Also evident were tones reminiscent of earth, lichen, moss, ochre and terracotta. Other prominent trends included fabrics with metallic aspects, and prints in tonal details and muted tones. In terms of pattern, woven checks and stripes were important, as were prints in paisleys, exotic florals, abstract designs and geometric designs. © Textiles Intelligence Limited 2019."

To teach these concepts in a more context-rich way, we asked students in an introductory class how they would arrange a power supply, bulb and one or two switches to make an AND gate, a NOT gate, and an OR gate. Then, we challenged them to combine these gates to make an adder circuit with two input switches and two output bulbs that could add two numbers. Finally, we built the circuit, using large relays with transparent cases so that students can actually see (and hear) how, for example, current flows through the AND gate when both input switches are thrown. For many students, this is the first time they intuitively grasp the relevance of basic circuit concepts to the complicated devices, like computers, that we use in everyday life. © 2019 World Scientific Publishing Company."

However, risk factors for LNM in esophageal T1b EAC are not clearly defined. The aim is to evaluate risk factors for LNM in T1b EAC patients who underwent esophagectomy or ER with ≥5 years of follow-up post-procedurally. Methods: This is a retrospective analysis completed at a large tertiary referral center. Patients who underwent esophagectomy or ER with ≥5 years follow-up, with histologically proven T1b EAC between 2010 and 2017 were included. LNM was considered positive with histologically or radiologically confirmed metastasis in esophagectomy specimens or within 5 years of follow-up post-ER. Results: Forty patients (median age 69 years; 85% males) formed the study cohort of which 36 patients (90.0%) underwent esophagectomy and 4 patients who were not surgical candidates underwent ER. Seven (17.5%) patients developed LNM per study criteria. Tumor size was significantly (P=0.019) associated with the risk of LNM, and the optimal threshold at which tumor size as associated with metastasis was 3 cm. No other risk factors including lymphovascular invasion, differentiation on pathology, or infiltration growth pattern were associated with LNM.

This includes a general discussion of the available methodology, which provides edge probabilities and models that are focused on the reconstruction of edge values. Besides summariz-ing their advantages and shortfalls, we conduct a competitive comparison of the approaches using Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) MT 103 single customer credit transfers. The comparison concerning the binary reconstruction is divided into an evaluation of the edge probabilities and of the accuracy of the predicted edge values. To test the methods on different topologies, the application is split into two parts. The first part considers the full MT 103 network, providing an illustration of the reconstruction of large, sparse financial networks. The second part is concerned with reconstructing a subset of the full network, repre-senting a dense medium-sized network. Regarding substantial outcomes, it is found that there are some methods that do work well in many respects. However, that does not imply that a certain method is generally superior. In general, the preferred model choice highly depends on the goal of the analysis, the presumed network structure and the availability of exogenous information. © 2021 Infopro Digital Risk (IP) Limited."

The inner organs, on the other hand, are normally arranged in bilaterally asymmetric patterns. Congenital deviations from the normal organ asymmetry can occur in the form of mirror imagery of the normal arrangement (situs inversus), or in the form of arrangements that have the tendency for the development of bilateral symmetry, either in a pattern of bilateral left-sidedness (left isomerism) or bilateral right-sidedness (right isomerism). The latter two forms of visceral situs anomalies are called ""heterotaxy syndromes"". During the past 30 years, remarkable progress has been made in uncovering the genetic etiology of heterotaxy syndromes. However, the pathogenetic mechanisms causing the spectrum of cardiovascular defects found in these syndromes remain poorly understood. In the present report, a spontaneous case of left cardiac isomerism found in an HH-stage 23 chick embryo is described. The observations made in this case confirmed the existence of molecular isomerism in the ventricular chambers previously noted in mouse models. They, furthermore, suggest that hearts with left cardiac isomerism may have the tendency for the development of non-compaction cardiomyopathy caused by defective development of the proepicardium. © 2019 by the author."

This is in large part due to the efforts of Charles Marohn, Jr., and the Strong Towns nonprofit organization he founded. Much of Strong Towns’ work is dedicated to educating the public on the fiscal unsustainability of sprawl. This research applies a Strong Towns–inspired per-parcel cost-revenue analysis to the road infrastructure maintenance obligations of the city of Gallatin, Tennessee. The study found that the fiscally solvent area of Gallatin (a radius of approximately 1.25 miles from the city hall) overlays the 1969 limits of urbanization — before widespread suburbanization began in the city — remarkably well. Commercial and industrial properties also meet this standard. The study also found there is an inverse relationship between sprawl and the solvent area: as sprawl and roads expand, the fiscally solvent area decreases. Reducing the miles of roadway requiring maintenance lowers the total repair bill, which allows more parcels to clear the hurdle of “paying for themselves” with the portion of their tax dollars set aside for roads. The optimal ratio of highway miles to land area and density would be an exciting metric to discover and presents an opportunity for further research. © 2019, Locke Science Publishing Company, Inc.

Materials and methods: Phosphate metabolites of muscles were detected while subjects were in a state of rest, during exercise and recovery. The phosphocreatine (PCr), inorganic phosphate (Pi), adenosine triphosphate (ATP), PCr/Pi, PCr/ATP, pH, work/energy cost ratio (WE) and oxidative capacity were compared between muscles. Results: The quadriceps had larger volume, heavier exercise load, greater WE, lower PCr and Pi concentration than calves muscles at rest. The PCr/Pi ratio of both muscles exhibited a sharp decline during exercise. PCr/ATP also had a downtrend in during exercise. Meanwhile, PCr/ATP of quadriceps during exercise was lower than that of calves muscles. The ATP concentration and pH value of quadriceps were decreased in end exercise compared to rest. And our results indicated that quadriceps had higher energy transfer efficiency and relatively poor energy buffering capability than calves muscles. The change in log(PCr) could adopt a linear fit model for both muscles at recovery. Conclusion: Quadriceps had higher energy transfer efficiency and relatively poor energy buffering capability than calves muscles in mitochondrial energy metabolism partially accounts for different fiber type compositions. © 2019, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd."

This paper analyzes four plays of Sircar, namely, Evam Indrajit (And Indrajit), Baki Itihas (That Other History), Tringsha Shatabdi (Thirtieth Century), and Shesh Nei (There’s No End), in the context of the references made to the prevailing sociopolitical problems of that era and examines how Sircar throws light on the fact that man alone is responsible for bringing destruction to the world and inviting disharmony in his life. It further attempts to establish the fact that through his plays, Sircar intensifies the guilt in man and urges him to take responsibility for the occurrences around him. A study of the selected plays helps understand the emphasis that Sircar puts on the need for a social reformation, which can happen only through the collective efforts of mankind. © 2019l IUP.All Rights Reserved."

Methods: Patients ≤75 years with performance status ≤1 and adequate organ function were treated at three-week intervals with docetaxel on day 1 and 80 mg/m2 oral S-1 from days 1–14. The starting docetaxel dose was 45 mg/m2 and this was escalated to a maximum of 70 mg/m2 . In phase II, response rate, progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and safety were assessed. Results: The recommended doses were 50 mg/m2 docetaxel (day 1) and 80 mg/m2 S-1 (days 1–14). Grades 3 and 4 leukocytopenia and neutropenia occurred in 44% and 67% of patients, respectively. Nonhematologic toxicities were generally mild. Overall response to chemotherapy was 7.7% (95% confidence interval (CI), 1.6–20.9%), and median PFS and OS were 18.0 weeks (95% CI; 11.3–22.9 weeks) and 53.0 weeks, respectively. Conclusion: Fifty mg/m2 docetaxel plus 80 mg/m2 oral S-1 had a lower response rate than anticipated; however, the survival data were encouraging.

The power-law shear-thinning viscosity-shear rate model for the anisotropic solutions and the Rosseland approximation for the thermal radiation through a highly absorbing medium is considered. The temperature-dependent heat sources, Joule heating, and viscous heating are considered to be the source terms in the energy balance. The non-dimensional boundary-layer equations are solved numerically in terms of similarity variable. A parameter study on the boundary value of chemical reaction and Nusselt number is performed as a function of thermal radiation parameter, Brinkman number, Prandtl number, Hartmann number, power-law index, heat source coefficient, Brownian parameter, thermophoresis parameter, and the chemical reaction parameter. The results show that the chemical reaction parameter has an increasing effect on the chemical reaction boundary while the magnetic, thermophoresis, and Brownian effects decrease the rate of the chemical reaction at the boundary. © 2019 by the author.

Based on the key low-frequency signals and the NCEP Climate Forecast System Version 2 (CFSv2) model forecasting products, a dynamical-statistical method is established for the extended-range forecast of EHRPs. The results suggest that EHRPs have a close relationship with the 10-30 d low-frequency oscillation of 850 hPa zonal wind over Hainan Island and to its north, and that they basically occur during the trough phase of the low-frequency oscillation of zonal wind. The latitudinal propagation of the low-frequency wave train in the middle-high latitudes and the meridional propagation of the low-frequency wave train along the coast of East Asia contribute to the "" north high (cold), south low (warm)"" pattern near Hainan Island, which results in the zonal wind over Hainan Island and to its north reaching its trough, consequently leading to EHRPs. With the link between low-frequency circulation and EHRPs being considered, a low-frequency wave train index (LWTI) is defined and adopted to forecast EHRPs by using NCEP CFSv2 forecasting products. EHRPs are predicted to occur during peak phases of LWTI with value larger than 1 for three or more consecutive forecast days. Hindcast experiments for EHRPs in 2015-2016 indicate that EHRPs can be predicted 8-24 d in advance, with an average period of validity of 16.7 d. © 2019, Journal of Tropical Meteorology Editorial Office.

Based on new corpus data, I claim that such constructions may correlate with a learners’ degree of first language (L1) literacy. In detail, and consistent with, both literate and non-literate learners overgeneralise functional forms while working on the newly acquired morphosyntax; this shows that the non-literates are perfectly able to subconsciously identify functional forms in the input.

The inclusive nature of Indian nationalism has been eroded, however, as a big corporate sector has grown in the economy and the Hindutva ideology has grown alongside it. What has now happened is an alliance between the two forces, the ‘neo-liberal’ regime in the economy having its counterpart in a ruling semi-fascist ideology. The latter presents the Hindus as a homogenous whole, whose dominance, it aims at establishing. In reality, it serves the interests of the corporate-financial oligarchy, and so is adverse to the well-being of the vast majority of India’s population. © 2019 Aligarh Historians Society."

Since the early 1990s, Russia has been charting new paths towards democracy and market-oriented institutions. How did Russia’s integration with the global economy reshape its power in internal political and economic gender frameworks? To answer this question this article maps out the gender impact of political and economic reforms under Yeltsin. We argue that some of these reforms fueled a conservative turn in social attitudes that legitimized gender inequalities in the political economy of Russia, marginalizing women both as workers and as political actors. Our findings suggest that the transition to a new political economy created new social risks with far-reaching consequences for gender equality. © 2019. All Rights Reserved."

There were increases in shipments of draw texturing machinery and shuttleless weaving machinery but there were declines in shipments of spinning machinery and knitting machinery. In spinning, shipments of short staple spindles declined by 9% in 2018 to their second lowest level since 2009 and their fourth lowest level since 2003. Shipments of open-end rotors were also down by 9%, although they were still at their second highest level since 1988. Shipments of long staple spindles, meanwhile, fell by a sharp 27% although they were still at their fourth highest level since 2008. In draw texturing, shipments of double heater false-twist spindles rose by 44% to their highest level since 2013, and shipments of single heater false-twist spindles soared by 2,051% to a record high. In the weaving sector, shipments of shuttleless looms rose by 40% to their second highest level on record. However, they remained below the peak reached in 2011. In the circular knitting sector, shipments of single jersey machinery fell by 5% to their lowest level since 2003 while shipments of double jersey machinery fell by 3%, although they were still at their third highest level on record. In the flat knitting sector, shipments of electronic flatbed knitting machinery were down by a sharp 21%. However, they were still at their second highest level on record. A geographical breakdown shows that the trends in shipments of yarn and fabric machinery to the textile industry in China were largely in line with world shipments, reflecting the fact that a large share of global shipments goes to the Chinese textile industry. Outside China, there were increases in shipments of eight of the nine major types of yarn and fabric machinery to the textile industries in Uzbekistan and Japan and there were increases in shipments of six of the nine major types of machinery to the textile industries in several other countries, including Cambodia, Egypt, Indonesia, Pakistan, Turkey and Vietnam. But there were declines in shipments of most types of machinery to the industries in a number of Western countries, including Brazil, Italy, Mexico, the UK and the USA. © Textiles Intelligence Limited 2019."

The plasma concentration of verapamil was measured using high-performance liquid chromatography with fluorometric detection. Heart rate (HR), cardiac output (CO), stroke volume (SV) and general peripheral vascular resistance (GPVR) were measured using integral rheography according to Tishchenko (Mingograf-410, Russia); blood pressure (BP) was measured by Korotkoff sounds. Analysis of verapamil pharmacokinetics in both experiments showed identity of the averaged curve profiles that did not differ significantly. The pharmacokinetic parameters were comparable. Based on hemodynamics analysis, HR elevation 1 h after verapamil administration was the most common reaction in both experiments; a short CO rise and GPVR decrease were observed in experiment 2 1 h after administration. These hemodynamic shifts were not pathologic and did not deviate from the physiological range in healthy people; changes in verapamil pharmacokinetics were also not detected. These findings provide the grounds to recommend verapamil for rational pharmacotherapy of cardiovascular diseases that may develop in piloted space missions. © 2019, Pleiades Publishing, Inc."

This study evaluates the effect of radial mismatch on the formation of radiolucent lines after TSA. Methods: We evaluated 451 TSAs at a mean follow-up of 5.4 years. All TSAs were performed using a single implant system that allows radial mismatch between 3.4 and 7.7 mm. Shoulders were retrospectively evaluated for radiographic glenoid loosening according to the Lazarus score. Shoulders were evaluated according to radial mismatch: 3.4 mm in 23, 4.3 mm in 154, 5.1 mm in 72, 5.9 mm in 81, 6.7 mm in 103, and 7.7 mm in 18. Clinical outcome measures included range of motion and American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons, University of California, Los Angeles, and Shoulder Pain and Disability Index scores. Results: At similar follow-up times, all groups demonstrated a similar incidence of glenoid radiolucencies and similar mean Lazarus scores. Shoulders in female patients were more commonly treated with implant combinations resulting in 4.3, 5.9, and 7.7 mm of radial mismatch (P < .001). Improvements in range of motion and American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons, University of California, Los Angeles, and Shoulder Pain and Disability Index scores were similar among all groups. Rates of reoperation secondary to glenoid loosening were similar among groups (P = .57). Moreover, the incidence of radiographic loosening (Lazarus grade 4 or 5) was similar among the groups (P = .22). Discussion: Variation in mismatch between 3.4 and 7.7 mm did not affect the incidence of glenoid lucent lines or Lazarus score. This finding suggests that optimal radial mismatch may extend below 5.5 mm, as previously recommended by Walch et al, without affecting the incidence and grade of glenoid lucencies. © 2019 The Authors"

The tools they used were part of the system they themselves designed for example a piece of string which be held at the mouth of the container and which reached to the bottom. If the containers were not embedded in the Earth they used the classical method of measuring the outside of the containers. Quite often the students became confused when reservoirs with the same volume (2 different houses) changed as regards one of the dimensions. The whole process was successful since finally after two months the student’s ability to calculate volume had increased, and since their achievement levels were compared with schoolmates who all had been taught in the classical way. © 2019, Roman Science Publications and Distributions.

The landscapes of gardens and parks in the Region include botanical gardens, arboretums and monuments of landscape art. A total of 15 objects were studied. The floras of parks were estimated by proportion of different groups (origin, naturalisation degree, time and ways of introduction) of synanthropic species. The synanthropic fraction of spontaneous flora was calculated using the indices of synanthropisation, apophytisation, anthropophytisation, archeophytisation, kenophytisation and modernisation. These indices were specified for each park and for the Middle Pobuzhzhia Region in general. The obtained data were compared to each other and to the analogous urban floras from different zones of Ukraine. It was revealed that the apophytisation processes were dominated by the processes of adventisation in most of the parks. The proportion of the synanthropic fraction of spontaneous flora of the Middle Pobuzhzhia Region was significantly lower compared to urban floras of some cities of Ukraine, and despite a considerable anthropogenic pressure retained some features of natural flora.  © 2019 Anna Kovtoniuk, published by Sciendo 2019."

We aimed to investigate the association of escitalopram dosing time with treatment response and changes in global depressive and insomnia symptoms after 8-week of antidepressant treatment in a naturalistic setting in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). Methods: A total of 71 patients with MDD taking escitalopram were recruited from the outpatient psychiatric clinic in a university hospital. The severity of depressive symptoms of all patients was assessed using the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) at the baseline and 8-week after the antidepressant treatment. The patients were classified into the Morning or Evening/Night group according to their time of escitalopram single dose. Results: The time of escitalopram single dose (morning vs. evening/night) was not associated with treatment response after 8-week of treatment when controlling for potential confounding factors in patients with MDD. No significant difference in changes in total HDRS score and insomnia-related subscale score was observed between the Morning and Evening/Night groups.

The significance of the research was in recognizing the importance the role of the mentor can play in raising awareness of patient safety and clinical governance principles and processes in the primary healthcare setting. Aims: Building on this preliminary research, this research aimed to explore primary healthcare workers and their mentor’s awareness of mentorship and clinical governance as part of a local Continuing Professional Development (CPD) program. Furthermore, it aimed to establish any relationship between the mentors, the mentee, and their awareness and application of clinical governance in the primary healthcare setting. Methodology: A quantitative research design using a survey was adopted. Data Collection Instrument: The researchers integrated previously validated questionnaires incorporating a Mentor Potential Scale, the Dimensions of Mentoring, and a Clinical Governance Awareness Questionnaire into a new questionnaire. This was called “Mentorship and Clinical Governance Awareness”. Sample: Convenience sample surveys were posted to complete and return to 480 primary healthcare workers undertaking post graduate study. Findings: A total of 112 completed questionnaires were included for the analysis amounting to a 23% response rate. A principle component factor analysis combining part 1— the characteristics of an effective mentor and part 2—the personality characteristics of an effective mentor identified four primary characteristics. These are: (1) “A Facilitatory Adviser”, (2) “Critically Enabling Facilitator”, (3) “A Change Facilitator”, and 4) “An Approachable Facilitator”. These newly identified characterizations according to the primary healthcare workers significantly impacted on their awareness and application of clinical governance in primary healthcare practice. Implications for primary healthcare practice and education: The newly devised questionnaire can be used to gauge the effectiveness of mentors and mentoring and how the characteristics of the role can impact on mentee’s awareness and application of clinical governance. Healthcare manager’s, leaders, and educators should focus their attention on how these newly established characteristics of the mentor can influence clinical governance awareness and application in healthcare the future. © 2019 by the authors.

However, flap harvesting can result in abdominal wall incisional hernia and bulge, which are challenging problems. Most of these problems occur below the arcuate line abdominal wall. However, there will be differences that are unique to each patient in the area of hernia or bulge. The open approach repair appears to be used most often, but the precise area of hernia and bulge is often not distinguished. This report describes a case that was treated using a new repair method, which had the clear advantage of allowing the precise area of abdominal wall weakness to be recognized. A 53-year-old man underwent left vertical RAM flap for reconstruction after tongue carcinoma resection. Six months after the operation, lower abdominal wall hernia and bulge were observed. Open laparoscopic-assisted repair was performed. Pneumoperitoneum led to distension of the abdominal cavity and outward stretching of the abdominal wall, so that the area of hernia and bulge protruded to a great degree. In this phase, by making the operating room slightly dark, the area became more clearly recognizable. When direct plication of the hernia and bulging area was required, the contralateral component separation technique was performed. This study describes an inventive repair procedure for abdominal wall hernia or bulge after RAM flap, with the combined advantages of open and laparoscopic repair.  Copyright © 2019 The Authors."

The correlation curves of IOD and the early modulation of the Huaxi region' s autumn precipitation indicated a behavioral change in the 1970s. Between 1960 and 1979, when the IOD was in a positive phase during autumn, circulations changed from a "" W"" shape to an "" M"" shape at 500 hPa in the middle-high latitude region in Asia. A northwest flow allowed a cold flux to reach Sichuan province. The positive anomaly of water vapor flux transported from the western Pacific to Huaxi region strengthened, causing a precipitation increase in the east Huaxi region. Between 1980 and 1999, when the IOD in autumn was also in the positive phase, the atmospheric circulation was a W"" shape at 500 hPa. In this scenario, the positive anomaly of the water vapor flux transported from the Bay of Bengal to Huaxi region strengthened, causing a precipitation increase in the west Huaxi region.

Conclusions: Patients with higher LVEF and lower baPWV had a similar overall and CV mortality as patients with higher LVEF and baPWV. Patients with lower LVEF and higher baPWV had the highest overall and CV mortality among the four study groups. In addition, patients with lower LVEF alone had a higher CV mortality than the patients with higher baPWV alone. Therefore, simultaneous consideration of cardiac and vascular function may be useful in predicting overall and CV mortality. © 2019 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland."

The paper concerns the influence of the resolution of images and the size of detected objects in pixels on measurements results. Test images of the objects of a known size were generated. The values of the perimeter of the objects were compared to the obtained values of measurements on the images with degraded resolution. The process of the degradation of the references images by successive downsizing the resolution, detection and measurements were performed applying automatic algorithm. The analysis of obtained results showed that the size of the analysed objects on the digital images plays an important role in reliability and accuracy of the measurement. The author concludes that, in order to avoid a bias in measurement caused by insufficient object resolution, the minimal acceptable size of objects on digital images in pixels should be recommended. © Production Engineering Archives 2019."

Misdiagnosed conservative treatments for serious lingual nerve (LN) injuries can induce the patient to serious mental disability. After continuous observation and critical diagnosis of the injury, in cases involving significant disruption of lingual nerve function, microneurosurgical reconstruction of the nerve is recommended. Direct anastomosis of the torn nerve ends without tension is the recommended approach. However, in cases that present significant gaps between the injured nerve ends, nerve grafts or conduits (tubes of various materials) are employed. Recently, various reconstruction materials for peripheral nerves were commercially offered especially in the USA, but the best method and material is still unclear in the world. There currently exists no conventional protocol for managing LN neurosensory deficiency in regard to optimal methods and the timing for surgical repair. In Japan, the allograft collagen nerve for peripheral nerves reconstruction was permitted in 2017, and we tried to use this allograft nerve and got a recommendable result. Case presentation: This report is a long-term abandoned torn LN reconstructed with allograft nerve induced by the lower third molar extraction. Conclusions: In early sick period, with the exact diagnosis, the LN disturbance should be managed. In a serious condition, the reconstruction with allograft nerve is one of the recommendable methods. © 2019, The Author(s)."

The flow model treats the fluid as a compressible mixture of air and water with homogeneous material properties. A high-resolution Godunov-type method is employed to solve the governing equations numerically. The impact loads in both pure water and aerated water conditions are investigated. The aerated water is modeled using the analogy with problems of shock wave propagation in compressible foam. It turns out that the impact force is found to increase with the velocity, as expected, and the aerated gas has a significant reduction on the impact load. © by The International Society of Offshore and Polar Engineers."

The present study investigated the effect of two physical features of tall buildings — height and color — on residents’ perceived psychological restoration. Color imaging was used to manipulate the variables. Height and color were each simulated at three levels: Tall, medium, and low for height and white, light gray, and dark gray for color, which were paired in different combinations for a total of nine images. Eighty residents of Hamedan, Iran, responded to questions related to the variables of fascination, being away, and restoration likelihood after viewing each image. According to the results, color did not explain restoration likelihood, but the effect of height on restoration likelihood was confirmed. Moreover, the effect of height and color on restoration likelihood was not mediated by being away or fascination. Analysis of the statistical mean of the dependent variable of psychological restoration indicated that, in tall and low buildings, gray colors resulted in higher restoration likelihood, with light gray being more effective than dark gray in the tall building. However, in buildings of medium height, the white color received the highest restoration-likelihood rating. © 2019, Locke Science Publishing Company, Inc."

From vehicle design point of view the windshield defrost system is typically connected to HVAC unit (Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning). In the technical solution the windshield is heated via hot air convection. Nevertheless, other methods are becoming more and more popular, like directly heated glass by hot wire ohmic heating (heated glasses). The defrost CFD model should predict the ice layer thickness in time and space and in environmental conditions defined according to appropriate directives and technical solution. The accurate and fast modelling technique is essential part of a vehicle development, especially nowadays, where the optimization techniques area widely used and requires hundreds of simulations runs. Modelling requests are even increasing with modern pure electric vehicles (EVs), were the thermal and energy management is more demanding compared to the classical internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles.

Historically, providers have used a one-size fits all approach, such that surveillance guidelines incorporated few important prognostic indicators for recurrence and survival. The goal of this study was to determine optimal timing for detection of recurrence by CT scan and the association between surveillance CT and overall survival. Methods: This was a retrospective, single institution series of patients undergoing surgical resection [2008-2012] with stage I or II disease (AJCC 7th edition) with at least 6 months of follow-up. Results: Recurrence occurred in 27.2% of patients at a median of 29.5 months following surgery. Recurrences peaked at 2-3 years following surgery for the entire cohort. For those detected on CT scan surveillance, stage I the peak timing for recurrence was at 25-36 months (year 3) whereas stage II peak timing was at 19-24 months (year 2) following resection. Timing of recurrences detected by any means differed significantly based on cancer stage with 81% (n=27) of recurrences occurring more than 24 months following surgery for stage I patients compared to 41% (n=17) of stage II patients (P<0.01). Overall, higher rates of surveillance CT scans were associated with a reduced risk of death [HR 0.14 (95% CI, 0.06-0.36) P<0.01]. Conclusions: The timing of recurrence differs significantly based on stage such that few stage I patients have recurrences within 2 years following surgical resection. Additionally, rates of recurrence detected by surveillance CT scans performed less than 24 months following surgery is significantly lower for stage I patients compared to stage 2 which would favor delaying routine surveillance in this select group. Optimal timing of CT surveillance based on peak recurrence rates has the potential to eliminate unnecessary testing and expense for healthcare systems. © Precision Cancer Medicine.

In nature, steels are macroscopically inhomogeneous. Reactor pressure vessel (RPV) steel has different fracture toughness with varying distance from the inner surface of the wall due to the higher cooling rate at the surface (deterministic material inhomogeneity). On the other hand, the T0 value itself behaves like a random parameter when the datasets have large scatter because the datasets are for several different materials (random inhomogeneity). In this paper, four regions, the surface, 1/8 T, 1/4 T, and 1/2 T, were considered for fracture toughness specimens of Korean Standard Nuclear Plant (KSNP) SA508 Gr. 3 steel to provide information on deterministic material inhomogeneity and random inhomogeneity effects. Fracture toughness tests were carried out for the four regions at three test temperatures in the transition region and the microstructure of each region was analyzed. The amount of upper bainite increased toward the center, which has a lower cooling rate; therefore, the center has lower fracture toughness than the surface so reference temperature (T0) is higher. The fracture toughness was evaluated using the bimodal master curve (BMC) approach. The results of the BMC analyses were compared with those obtained via a conventional master curve analyses. The results indicate that the bimodal master approach considering inhomogeneous materials provides a better description of scatter in the fracture toughness data than a conventional master curve analysis does.

Both groups were surveyed using a self-designed demographic questionnaire, and the self-concept level was determined using the six-dimensional Piers-Harris Children's Self-Concept Scale (PHCSS). The differences were compared between two groups using Chi-square test, non-parametric test, and multiple regression analysis.Results:We released a total of 598 questionnaires, and 576 valid questionnaires were received, including 267 in the acne group and 309 in the healthy group. The subscale score of the popularity dimension of the PHCSS in the acne group (8.89 ± 1.780) was significantly lower than that in the healthy group (9.45 ± 1.78, P < 0.01). When only the girls were considered, compared with the healthy group, the acne group had a significantly lower total PHCSS score (58.72 ± 12.15 vs. 61.47 ± 11.14, P < 0.05) and significantly lower subscale scores for physical appearance and attributes (6.68 ± 3.26 vs. 7.97 ± 3.30, P < 0.05), happiness and satisfaction (7.70 ± 1.85 vs. 8.12 ± 1.47, P < 0.05), and popularity (8.69 ± 1.82 vs. 9.84 ± 1.67, P < 0.01). Furthermore, multiple regression analysis revealed the girls' relationship with their parents and classmates, and the paternal educational background showed a significantly impact on the self-consciousness of the acne girls.Conclusion:Acne vulgaris significantly lowers the self-concept of girls in junior high school. The factors influencing the PHCSS scores of girls with acne were the relationship with parents and classmates, and the paternal educational background. © 2029 Hospital for Skin Diseases (Institute of Dermatology), Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, and Chinese Medical Association, published by Wolters Kluwer, Inc.."

Chomsky’s universal generative grammar is applicable to law in a direct way but the theory is still extendable to semantics and pragmatics of law.

However, the modern western cities, which are the origins of secularity, have inspired poets in different ways. Charles Baudelaire captured the poetic dimensions of modernity in Paris in the 19th century. He wrote about the night life of Paris which became possible after street lighting. He wrote about corruption. Baudelaire also wrote about the changing character of commercial places in cities and tried to grasp the feelings of people as a ‘flaneur': an individual stroller at city streets. The philosopher Walter Benjamin got inspired by Baudelaire's poems and formed his philosophy, which relates poetics to modernity during the 20th century. Modern cities take an important role in his philosophy too, because Benjamin was making a collection of political event news in the cities of Germany. Then he had to leave Germany because of the growth of fascism. He left his collection behind. When he went to Paris he wrote about the passages and the poetic dimensions of modern city life. When Nazi army came to France, he had to leave Paris too. The poetry of Baudelaire and the philosophy of Benjamin are evidences for the poetic nature of modern city life. The relationship between the modern city and the free individual can easily be felt in their works. However, when you read heir work, you can easily understand that today's Paris is not the same Paris any more. It is still poetic, but in another way. © 2019 Emerald Publishing Limited."

Severe storms are predicted by climate change models to increase globally and in frequency into the 22nd century. In April 2018, a population of breeding Cooper's hawks (Accipiter cooperii) in central Wisconsin, USA, experienced three days of heavy snowfall in the most severe storm, in preincubationstage, for 39 years (1980-2018). Here I report select demographic outcomes of this nesting population following this intense weather. The median hatching date of 10 June in 2018 was the sixth latest such metric in those 39 years (and the latest in 22 years since 1996) for this population, which has advanced its breeding schedule about 1.3 days/decade due to climate change or warming. Survival of a total of 16 colormarked breeding adults, 15 males and 1 female, observed prestorm in the nesting areas, was 100% up through the late nestling stage in the same nesting areas where these birds were initially detected in 2018. Average clutch size (4.4 eggs/nest) and average brood size (4.0 young/ nest) were similar to the overall average annual metrics of these demographics for this population in the earlier 38 study years. Nest success, whereby 95% of 21 nests with eggs produced advancedaged young, was higher in 2018 than the overall average of 77% nest success rate during the earlier years. The later timing of hatching in 2018, likely due to the severe spring snowstorm, appeared to have no deleterious effects either on survival of the breeding adults or on the reproductive output of this healthy study population.

However, the relationship between them and the current occurrence of them in Chinese elderly people was weak. Methods: To investigate the details of these two functions in Chinese elderly people and to try to find some early recognition and intervention clues, data of MMSE test and usual gait speed from 4487 elderly people from seven provinces in China were analysed. Results: The prevalence of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia in persons aged 60 and over was 17.83% and 4.08%, respectively. Among 11 items of MMSE, calculation, three-word recall, drawing two pentagons, and temporal orientation were the most commonly impaired items in persons with MCI or dementia. The gait speed of old persons with dementia was significantly slower than that of persons with MCI or NCI. Meanwhile, old persons with gait speed >1.39 m/s fast gait speed also had high MMSE scores and no dementia was detected by MMSE. Conclusion: The prevalence of dementia observed in this population was similar to that reported 20 years ago. Loss of temporal orientation and drawing two pentagons may supply more information for early recognition of cognitive impairment. Maintaining locomotion in a proper way may help old persons to prevent cognitive function decline. © 2019 The Authors.

Then, the mixed centroid method is compared with the traditional geometric center method and the centroid method. Simulation comparisons demonstrate that the proposed method offers high precision and low calibration cost, thereby improving the calibration accuracy of the target.

Conventional spectral principal component analysis (PCA) compresses the multi-dimensional spectral data exclusively on amplitude maps at interpreted seismic horizon. This overlooks the time-variant nature of spectral amplitudes. Hence, it is difficult to estimate thin-layer thickness variations directly from the conventional horizon-based spectral PCA (HSPCA) results. A trace-based spectral principal component analysis (TSPCA) method is proposed for seismic thin-layer thickness delineation. Compared to HSPCA, TSPCA calculates spectral principal components (PCs) within a time window over the targeted seismic event on a trace-by-trace basis. Trace-based spectral PCs are assumed independent, i.e., as amplitude responses from reflection events with different frequency characteristics. A rotation of PC coefficients following the Varimax criterion is proposed to automatically interpret the three most significant spectral PCs as related to (1) reflection amplitude determined by rock impedances, (2) tuning of a pure even-reflection pair, or (3) tuning from a pure odd-reflection pair. The latter two types of tuning-related amplitude are both governed by thin-layer thickness and have different frequency responses. Results on synthetic wedge models of pure odd- and even-reflection pair thin layers show that the trace-based spectral PCs show a distinct relationship to thin-layer thickness. Comparing spectral PC images calculated on a geologically complex 3D model after HSPCA and TSPCA methods, we conclude that TSPCA has superior capability for precise thickness delineation, especially for subtle thickness variations in the model.  © 2019 Geophysical Press Ltd."

The geometry in close vicinity to the inlet valve seats was designed to increase swirl and flow performance of the cylinder heads. A three-dimensional (3D) printer was used to realize a rapid prototyping concept for the testing of multiple designs; the effects of the different designs were measured using a static flow test bench and a laser-optical method to visualize the flow patterns. The results of the static flow bench tests showed potentially higher flow and swirl performance, with one high-swirl version proving beneficial specifically for lean-combustion and one high-flow version matching the Miller combustion requirements. The two cylinder head versions were then manufactured and the lean-combustion version was tested for on-engine performance on a 150 kW sewage-gas driven lean-combustion engine. It has been shown that the cylinder head generates higher swirl on the test bench but achieves only a slight increase in combustion speed on the test engine. The potential to increase engine efficiency by intensifying swirl is, therefore, considered exploitable. Research has further shown the coefficient of variance (CoV) was reduced by 0.3-1.2%. Charge exchange losses have also been demonstrated to decrease at all tested engine settings. It has further been found that higher swirl intensity has a positive impact on engine emission levels, as the engine out carbon monoxide (CO) emission can be reduced by approximately 70 mg·m-3. © 2019 American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME).

Based on the secondary database, it argues that the labor market is characterized by widespread unemployment, and there has been an increase in the share of marginal workers over the years in the study villages, as well as in rural Jalpaiguri. The analysis of primary data reveals that tea cultivation and agriculture were main sources of employment of informal workers; however, these did not provide livelihood security. The wage rate was lower than the legally prescribed minimum wage in West Bengal. Also, the workers, most of whom were either Scheduled Castes or Scheduled Tribes, did not receive year-round employment in the study villages. In the absence of remittances from the migrant workers, a substantial number of households were poor. The research shows that informal wage work in the study area was insufficient for a decent level of living.

Modeling synchronization of wave dynamics is critical in various applications such as in communications and neuroscience. In this paper, we study the synchronization problem for oscillations governed by wave equation with nonlinear (van der Pol type) boundary conditions through a single boundary coupling. The dynamics of the master system is self-excited and presents sensitive and rapid oscillations. With the only signal received at one end of the boundary, by constructing a mathematical model, we show the existence of a slave system that can be synchronized with the master system via the study of wave reflections on the boundary to recover the actual wave dynamics. The coupling gain, which represents the strength of the connection between the master system and the slave system, has been identified. The obtained result can be also viewed as an observer construction when the measurable output is only on the boundary.

This study aimed to identify the relationships between science and technology parks and the libraries working out of the universities with which they are associated. Method. Case studies based on a survey were conducted of 137 members of the International Association of Science Parks and Areas of Innovation, eight-eight libraries in universities with which they are related and five park information units. Analysis. The analysis focused on four topics: types of university-park relationships and their particulars; types of information services provided; ways to access information; and characteristics of library-park collaboration. Results. The existence of library-park relationships was confirmed, and service accessibility found to be determined by the links between the park and the respective university. The working arrangements concluded by some science and technology parks and libraries attest to the value of inter-institutional collaboration. Conclusion. Strengthening science and technology park relations with libraries in associated universities would benefit entrepreneurs. The resulting enhancement of their business projects through information would afford a wide range of opportunities. A broader study covering a larger number of parks, university libraries and incubated companies worldwide would yield the data required to draw up guidelines for providing such companies with the information they need to conduct their business. © the authors, 2019."

Methods: A total of 20 NPC patients who had received radiotherapy were re-planned by the volumetric modulated arc therapy plan. Three volumetric modulated arc therapy plans with different isocenters were generated for each patient: the first plan using the center of PGTVnx as the isocenter (AP-V), the second plan using the center of PGTVnd as the isocenter (BP-V), and the third plan using the center of PTV2 as the isocenter (CP-V). The conformity and homogeneity indexes of the target, dose-volume histogram of organs at risk, normal tissue, volume of dose, and monitor units were compared for the three plans. Results: AP-V provided a significantly lower maximum dose for the optic nerves and optic chiasm; lower mean dose for the eyeballs; lower absolute volume >10 Gy, absolute volume >20 Gy, and absolute volume >30 Gy; and fewer monitor units than BP-V and CP-V. BP-V and CP-V provided a significantly lower absolute volume >50 Gy than AP-V. In the conformity indexes of PGTVnd and PTV2, BP-V and CP-V were significantly better than in AP-V. In the homogeneity index of PTV2, BP-V and CP-V were significantly better than in AP-V. In general, there is no significant difference between BP-V and CP-V. Conclusions: All three plans achieved the clinical demands. AP-V decreased the volumes of absolute volume >10 Gy, absolute volume >20 Gy, and absolute volume >30 Gy, whereas BP-V and CP-V decreased the volume of absolute volume >50 Gy. In terms of organs at risk, AP-V offered better protection of the optic nerves, optic chiasm, and eyeballs for NPC than BP-V and CP-V. Most importantly, AP-V enhanced the utilization of the monitor units. For this reason, we propose that the radiotherapy technician put the location position in the PGTVnx center during simulation of the NPC patients.

Aims: The aim of this quality improvement project was to implement and assess anticoagulation management by a pharmacist-managed warfarin anticoagulation service in LVAD patients. Materials and Methods: This was a pilot study to assess the outcomes of anticoagulation management by a pharmacist-managed outpatient anticoagulation service for the first 3 months following hospital discharge of patients with a newly implanted LVAD compared with a historical control group of LVAD patients managed by the previous standard-of-care. Time in therapeutic range and percent of international normalized ratio (INR) values within range were assessed as measures of anticoagulation. Twenty-six patients were in the intervention group and an equal number of controls were included for analysis. Results: Patients in the pharmacist-managed intervention group experienced a significantly greater INR time in therapeutic range than the control group (66% vs 46.9%; P = 0.003) and a greater percentage of INRs within therapeutic range (62.6% vs 43.8%; P = 0.002). Discussion and Conclusion: Pharmacist-managed anticoagulation was associated with improved INR control in this pilot group of LVAD patients in the first 3 months posthospital discharge. Additional study is warranted to determine if this benefit continues beyond 3 months, and to further assess clinical outcomes of thrombosis and bleeding events between groups. © 2019 Pharmacotherapy Publications, Inc."

In many structures, there are rubber isolators that connect component parts, and these connections can each occur over a finite distributed area. It is often convenient and intuitive to substructure the system at the isolators. However, in previous work, it has been shown that the frequency response of the complete system does not always agree with the frequency response of the system calculated from the mobilities of the subsystems. It was thought that this was due to the distributed area connection of the isolators, and this motivated the study reported in this article. An investigation into some issues that occur when substructuring a system that contains soft distributed isolators is described. Using finite element models, it is shown that if a system is substructured, such that the interface between the substructures occurs at a soft rubber isolator, then there is a limited frequency range over which the frequency response function of the assembled system is accurate. It is further shown that it is far better to substructure the system, at stiff, discrete connections, if possible. The frequency range over which the frequency response of the assembled system should then be more accurate over a much wider frequency range. © 2019 by ASME."

This article unlocks the secret to his status as the most admired of fictional attorneys by demonstrating the role that his rhetoric plays in his exemplary fulfillment of the duties of an attorney to zealously represent clients, to serve as an officer of the court, and to act as a public citizen with a special responsibility for the quality of justice. Always using the simplest accurate wording, focusing on reason over emotion, and speaking in the same manner whether in private or in public, Atticus's rhetoric exemplifies the ancient Roman style known by students of rhetoric as ""Attic."" Using this style to navigate the potential for conflict among his duties, Atticus reveals the power, the elegance, and the ethical necessity of Attic rhetoric. Connecting Atticus's name to the Attic style of rhetoric for the first time, this article advances several scholarly debates by demonstrating the mutual compatibility of the duties imposed by the Model Rules of Professional Conduct and proffering a powerful tool to attorneys seeking to practice or to teach improved ethical conduct. © 2019 Michelle Kundmueller, published by Sciendo."

While the state continues to experiment with different forms of local resource governing organisations, the current article investigates two such DGNR organisations, that is, the Chilika Development Authority and Primary Fishery Cooperative located at Chilika to understand varied issues faced by Chilika fisheries.

Little is known about skeletal changes following stroke beyond density loss. In this study, we use a mild-moderate middle cerebral artery occlusion model to determine the effects of ischemic stroke without bedrest on bone microstructure, dynamic bone formation, and tissue composition. Twenty-seven 12-week-old male C57Bl/6J mice received either a stroke or sham surgery and then either received daily treadmill exercise or remained sedentary for 4 weeks. All mice were ambulatory immediately following stroke, and limb coordination during treadmill exercise was unaffected by stroke, indicating similar mechanical loading across limbs for both stroke and sham groups. Stroke did not directly detriment microstructure, but exercise only stimulated adaptation in the sham group, not the stroke group, with increased bone volume fraction and trabecular thickness in the sham distal femoral metaphysis. Stroke differentially decreased cortical area in the distal femoral metaphysis for the affected limb relative to the unaffected limb, as well as endosteal bone formation rate in the affected tibial diaphysis. Although exercise failed to improve bone microstructure following stroke, exercise increased mineral-to-matrix content in stroke but not sham. Together, these results show that stroke inhibits exercise-induced changes to femoral microstructure but not tibial composition, even without changes to gait. Similarly, affected-unaffected limb differences in cortical bone structure and bone formation rate in ambulatory mice show that stroke affects bone health even without bedrest.

Further, the dynamic fluid pressure, the wave height of the liquid, the shear force and the overturning moment at the bottom of the spherical tank is calculated, and a simplified dynamic model of spherical tank considering liquid sloshing and swinging effect was constructed. The seismic response was studied and compared with the results without considering the swing effect. The results show that: for I, II site conditions, base shear force and overturning moment of considering the swing effect is slightly smaller than when nonconsidering and the difference rate between the two is very small. III-IV site conditions, each condition value of considering the swing effect is larger than when nonconsidering and the difference rate between the two is relatively large.

On the one side, in Italy it has been noted that a progressive erosion of the offenses subject to criminal sanctions, less harsh criminal sanctions and a low rate of judicial application of the aggravated circumstance in these cases of hate speech have occurred; on the other side, an extensive interpretation of the antidiscrimination law by civil courts and a greater engagement of such social actors as organisations in monitoring and denouncing cases of hate speech have taken place in most recent years. An analysis of the legislation within the paradigm of the “social working of law”, elaborated by John Griffiths, leads to the conclusion that the criminal law against hate speech exerts special and general effects, rather than merely symbolic effects at the shop floor. © 2019.

An elevation in uric acid levels in the blood leads to many health problems, such as gout, electrolyte disturbances, and renal failure. Recently, recombinant UOX has been approved by the FDA to be used as a therapeutic agent for the treatment of hyperuricemia and Tumor Lysis Syndrome (TLS). Moreover, it is used to manufacture diagnostic kits for enzymatic uric acid determination. In the present study, we cloned the UOX gene from Aspergillus Niger. The open reading frame of an UOX of 906 bp, encoding a protein of 302 amino acids, was synthesized using previous data from Genbank and cloned in pET-15b. The predicted amino acid sequence was used as a template to screen orthologues from evolutionarily related organisms and to explore their phylogenetic relationships. The monomeric subunit secondary structure was constructed; the molecular weight from the predicted amino acid sequences was 34.0 kDa and the isoelectric point value (pI) was7.19.

Objective: The objective of this study was to compare a modified CP2 score to the original CP2 score in an adult medicine residency clinic and assess whether a modified CP2 score more appropriately captured patients in need of recommendations from a clinical pharmacist. Methods: A convenience sample of patients scheduled for visits in an adult medicine clinic had a comprehensive medication review (CMR) performed. All patients had the original CP2 score and modified CP2 score calculated retrospectively. Both versions of the CP2 scores were compared using Pearson correlation. The relationship between a recommendation from a pharmacist and each CP2 score was evaluated using Pearson correlation and t test. Results: In total, 148 patients who received a CMR by a clinical pharmacist were included in the retrospective chart review. Overall, there was a strong positive correlation between the CP2 score and the modified CP2 score (correlation coefficient (r) 0.968, P < 0.001); thus, as the CP2 scores increase, the modified CP2 score increases. Patients with higher CP2 and modified CP2 scores were more likely to receive a recommendation from a pharmacist (P < 0.001 and P < 0.001, respectively). There was a moderate correlation between both scores and number of recommendations made (CP2: r = 0.436 [P < 0.001], modified CP2: r = 0.456 [P < 0.001]) which did not differ significantly.

These outcomes include psychiatric disorders, poor psychosocial functioning, homelessness, substance abuse and incarceration. Unfortunately, individuals with mental health problems may find themselves arrested for misdemeanors such as trespassing, alcohol and drug related charges, disorderly conduct or other less serious charges. If a person is determined to be psychiatrically unstable, they may be held in jail while waiting for a psychiatric evaluation, waiting for a hospital bed, or for transportation to a psychiatric hospital for treatment. Situations arise that in which a person’s sentence is completed, but the court determines that they are not ready to live in the community because of actions that occurred while incarcerated, or because of the charges that resulted in incarceration. These offenders are then released to a psychiatric hospital for treatment to prepare them for community reintegration. When this cohort is sent to an inpatient setting involuntarily it makes treatment very challenging. It is essential for community reintegration and decarceration that we gain an understanding of how to successfully treat mentally ill offenders when they are moved from a criminal justice setting into an alternate treatment setting involuntarily.

Recently, selective inference, a kind of post-selection inference framework, has garnered the attention in the statistics and machine learning communities. By conditioning on a specific variable selection procedure, selective inference can properly control for so-called selective type I error, which is a type I error conditional on a variable selection procedure, without imposing excessive additional computational costs. While selective inference can provide a valid hypothesis testing procedure, the main focus has hitherto been on Gaussian linear regression models. In this paper, we develop a selective inference framework for binary classification problem. We consider a logistic regression model after variable selection based on marginal screening, and derive the high dimensional statistical behavior of the post-selection estimator. This enables us to asymptotically control for selective type I error for the purposes of hypothesis testing after variable selection. We conduct several simulation studies to confirm the statistical power of the test, and compare our proposed method with data splitting and other methods. © 2019, Japanese Federation of Statistical Science Associations."

Given the country’s limited resource-settings and relatively low expenditure on public health care, a more targeted approach to tackling the burden of child mortality may be considered. This article analyses secondary data on social indicators with regard to four key interventions associated with newborn and child health, namely: delivery care, feeding practices, preventive and curative disease control (immunisation, supplementation and inpatient care), and nutritional status.

"Thirty Years of Urban Bias: An Estimation of the Rising Disparities in Female Rural and Female Urban Unemployment and Income in Egypt","2019","Agrarian South","0","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85106750922&doi=10.1177%2f2277976019872326&partnerID=40&md5=dd6073a94e2f19a722f72886289cc45e","This article highlights the disparities between female urban and rural employment and income in Egypt over the last decades, mainly resulting from urban bias policies. Despite their inferior educational levels, females in rural Egypt manifested higher levels of employment than their counterparts in urban Egypt, a phenomenon that the article attributes to the standard definition of unemployment, which includes unpaid family members as part of the ‘employed’, besides other methodological issues. As such, statistics could misleadingly imply better female rural income compared to female urban income. By means of an innovative attempt to estimate female rural and urban incomes, this article provides some evidence that female rural per capita income accounts for only 0.43 of female urban per capita income, despite rising from 0.2 in 1981. The female rural/urban gap was mitigated when female national incomes rather than female per capita incomes were estimated, with female rural national income accounting for nearly 0.73 of female urban national income. © 2019 SAGE Publications."

The new French Labelling scheme “Energie Positive & Réduction Carbone” has adopted a multi-criteria and multi-stage approach to declare the energy consumptions and environmental efficiency of new buildings. A special focus has been put on Greenhouse gas emissions by defining a set of global threshold and subthreshold values covering the whole life cycle of the building and only the contribution Product and Construction Process stage including equipment. Results of different French cases studies for collective housing buildings and single houses shows a variation of less than 10% of the global emissions of greenhouse gas for buildings of different mode of construction (concrete structure, concrete masonry, clay masonry, wood structure …) having a similar energy efficiency of their thermal envelope. The contribution of concrete masonry units typically ranges from 2.5 to 10% of the total amount of the CO2 emission for the Product and Construction Process stages and consequently less than 5% of the emission for the total life cycle, respectively 4–15% and less than 8% for collective housing buildings.

Recent studies show the link between lipoprotein with cancer resistance and progression. Clinical data indicates that oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) play roles the progression of breast cancer. Therefore, purpose of this study was to determine the roles of lipoproteins on migration of breast cancer cell and compare the effects of oxLDL and VLDL. Methods: Parent MCF-7 cells were purchased from ATCC, while the Tamoxifen-resistant MCF-7 (Tam-R MCF-7) was developed by pulse treatment method. Tam-R cells were treated with gradual increase in tamoxifen concentration for 72 hours in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) without phenol red. Cell viability test was done to measure the fold changes of Tam-R MCF-7 cells. Migration characteristics was studied using wound healing assay. Cells were treated with 10 ?g/mL of oxLDL and VLDL up to 72 hours. Results: From the cell viability test, Tam-R MCF-7 cells had 4-fold increase of resistance than parental cells. Tam-R MCF-7 had acquired resistance to Tamoxifen and achieved a clinically relevant level of resistance. Lipoproteins were found to cause morphological changes, where cells exhibited elongation and dendritic-like growth compared to control cells. Both MCF-7 parental cells and Tam-R MCF-7 cells showed higher percentage of wound closure when treated with oxLDL. In contrast, VLDL treatment caused reduction in cell migration compared to oxLDL. Conclusion: Findings suggest that oxLDL may further promote resistant breast cancer cell migration compared to VLDL. © 2019 UPM Press. All rights reserved."

However, the modal parameter has exhibited a low sensitivity to the interfacial damage, such as the delamination in the composite beam. In this paper, a signal-processing method is developed to increase the sensitivity of the modal parameter to the delamination. Both the first- and high-order modal parameters are transformed to an approximate waveform capacity dimension (AWCD). Based on the wave peaks of the modal parameters in the AWCD, the start and the end of the delamination can be accurately pinpointed. Since the AWCD method can highlight the delamination-related waveform features of the modal parameters, the delamination can be identified without referring to the baselines. Both analytical and experimental investigations demonstrate that the AWCD method can modify the waveforms of the modal parameters and lead to an accurate identification of the delamination in composite cantilever beams. © 2019 by ASME."

We implemented a CURE within a senior-level biofluid mechanics course that was primarily taught using a flipped classroom approach. Due to the large class size, the students analyzed data that was publicly available and produced by one of our laboratories. Student teams then developed hypotheses based on the data analysis and designed a set of in vitro and in vivo experiments to test those hypotheses. The hypotheses and experiments that were most highly rated by the class were then tested in our laboratory. At the end of the class, student gains were assessed by self-report and compared to those self-reported by students engaging in a traditional freshman undergraduate summer research experience. While the students in the CURE reported moderate gains in self-assessment of research-based skills, their selfreported gains were statistically significantly lower than those reported by students who participated in the traditional research experience. We believe that the CURE could be improved through implementation in a lower level class, enabling students to observe laboratory experiments, and providing additional feedback throughout the hypothesis development and experimental design process. Overall, the CURE is an innovative way to expand research experiences, in particular for engineering students who often do not participate in hypothesis-driven research during their undergraduate education.

Antimicrobial dressing of Azithromycin (AZM) (a broad-spectrum macrolide antibiotic) with Chitosan (CS) as a carrier, has a lot of desired properties such as haemostatic, pain-reducing, and less scar forming. It is prepared by a solvent evaporation method. The film morphology is investigated by SEM and film-water wettability is measured by a contact angle method. The drug-polymer interactions are evaluated by using FTIR and DSC. Azithromycin loaded films (different mass ratio of AZM to CS w % 10%, 25% and 50%) were sterilized by Gamma radiation, then their antimicrobial characteristics and haemostatic performance were evaluated. Film thickness was about 9 μm. The wettability properties of films were enhanced by adding AZM and PEG6000 5% (mass ratio of PEG 6000 to CS w %).

To attenuate high-amplitude noise and reduce the effect of strong-energy noise on prestack migration, we have developed a method for the attenuation of high-amplitude noise in shot gathers. Based on the characteristics of high-amplitude noise, an amplitude attenuation equation (AAE) in the time-space (t-x) domain is used to suppress the energy of high-amplitude noise in seismic data. According to the proposed method, the average absolute amplitude within time window is calculated first. The average absolute amplitude obtained from the statistics is used as a threshold for judging high-amplitude noise. Then, we calculate the difference between the amplitude absolute value of each sample point and the threshold. Finally, the obtained difference is used as a variable of the amplitude attenuation function for suppressing high-amplitude noise. Tests on synthetic data and real data demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for attenuation of high-amplitude noise.  © 2019 Geophysical Press Ltd."

It is considered to be a prolific tool in the creation of neologisms. Many cognitive models tried to study metaphorisation processes by drawing on metaphor and metonymy based on linguistic evidence. However, recent studies have highlighted the necessity of carrying out empirical tests in order to provide refined results that go beyond the traditional theories of conceptual metaphor and metonymy. This paper analyzes the underlying metaphor in the ‘carbon capture and sequestration’ event in both English and Arabic. It also discusses the influence of English, the lingua franca, in the transfer of the neologism ‘carbon capture and sequestration’, via translation processes, and its role in the so-called domain loss in the target language. Results were obtained through a corpus-based contrastive terminological analysis, extracted from specialized texts in English and Arabic in the subdomain of climate change.

This paper is concerned with residual deformation of thin-walled pipe's cross section in a radial direction when external bending moment is removed. In order to clarify the fundamental ovalization characteristics, find out what factors influence the residual flattening (value of ovalization), the ovalization behavior is investigated experimentally. The experiments are carried out on 21 stainless steel specimens with different geometric parameters under different bending radii by means of a four-point pure bending device. The residual cross-sectional flattenings are monitored continuously by scanning the cross section periodically along the circumferential direction. From the experimental results, it is observed that the cross-sectional shape of the thin-walled pipe is not perfect standard ellipse, and the appearance of the maximum residual flattening is usually found in the direction normal to the neutral surface. It is also revealed the relationships between the residual flattening and the bending radius, the wall thickness, and the pipe outer diameter, i.e., the residual flattening increases as the bending radius and the wall thickness reduce, but it increases as the outer diameter increases. These results are expected to find their potential application in thin-walled pipe bending operation.  Copyright © 2019 by ASME."

These models have attempted to capture some of the variations across production sectors and the differences in market and non-market agents. However, the macroeconometric modelling effort so far has not captured the regional dimension of the economy. This paper notes that while there are commonalities in growth pattern across states exhibited by the co-integration of state domestic product in many pairs of states, there are also cases where the commonality is absent. We highlight the need for reflecting a regional dimension in the macroeconometric models either through satellite models or integration with the national models. © 2019, The Indian Econometric Society."

This was a cross-sectional, retrospective study on ASC-H cases. The follow-up results of ASC-H cases diagnosed during routine primary screening between 2011 and 2018 were evaluated, and the relationship between clinicopathological parameters, high risk Human Papilloma Virus (hrHPV) test and patients’ ages at diagnosis were evaluated. Among one hundred sixty-nine ASC-H patients, high grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) was detected in 56 (33.1%), low grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) in 59 (35%), squamous cell carcinoma in 5 (3%) and adenocarcinoma in 1 (0.5%). HPV 16 was detected in 41 (24.4%) cases and HPV 18 in 26 (16%) cases, and 51 patients had low risk of HPV (lrHPV). The mean age of the patients with hrHPV was 31.78 ± 8.22, and the mean age of the patients with lrHPV was 34.77 ± 5.47. HPV positivity in ASC-H smears was significantly correlated with age (p = 0.004). General linear regression analysis showed that biopsy results were significantly correlated with HPV in high-risk patients compared to low-risk patients. hrHPV evaluation in ASC-H follow-up is significant for cervical premalignant lesion.

The presence of this noise conceals the geological information conveyed by the seismic data and appropriate imaging of the underlying structure leads towards attenuating such noises. Ideally, the seismic footprint noise attenuation should be included within the seismic data processing steps; however, such a measure is not usually taken into the conventional processing sequence. For this purpose, an extra effort is required to be done in order to better understand the nature of the footprint noise which itself is dependent upon the geometry of acquisition and depth of the events. In this paper, a method based on applying the 2D recursive filter for footprint noise attenuation has been presented as a step within the seismic data processing sequence. This filter is different and superior to the conventional Cooley-Tukey filter and can significantly increase the seismic data quality.  © 2019 Geophysical Press Ltd."

Strikingly, genomic comparison identified, and subsequent RIL population and germplasm panel haplotype analyses confirmed, that large-scale inversions on chromosome At08 are widely distributed and have over time mediated the reduction of meiotic recombination that has ultimately driven genetically isolated haplotypes of G. hirsutum. This work is likely to become the new benchmark for cotton functional genomics research, and the scientific insights from the comparative analyses contributed substantially to our basic understanding of how genomic inversions influence meiotic recombination and thus lower genetic diversity in plant populations. © 2019, The Author(s)."

It is a common phenomenon where bone is the frequent metastatic site. Bone scan using 99m-Techetium-Methylenediphosphate (99mTc-MDP) is used to diagnose bone pathologies such as bone metastases. 99mTc-MDP specifically binds to calcium which present in bone. This study aimed to validate 99mTc-MDP in breast cancer-induced to bone rat model and to determine calcium presence in the progression of metastasis. The rats were divided into two groups (normal and cancer-induced groups). For cancer-induced group, the left femur was induced with breast cancer cell line, MDA-MB-231. After 21 days, all rats were subjected to SPECT-CT scan. Our finding suggests that the kidney uptake of 99mTc-MDP is due to the calcium crystal presence caused by hypercalcemia.

It employs a novel approach that sharply focuses on public involvement in the design process, using a quantitative methodology for the development of a suitable building program and selecting a memorial form that meets the public's needs in a practical way. The study drew on data from various memorial projects to identify possible spaces and their selection criteria. A written questionnaire was distributed to a sample of 105 members of the public, to narrow down the number of spaces according to public response. Then, a hearing (spoken) questionnaire was conducted on a sample of 20 to produce the program for development by generating the most strongly preferred form of memorial. The results contradicted the existing norm for a memorial as a sculpture; it was revealed that most of the public preferred memorial landscapes to buildings and great structures.

The ultimate question for each is: Does this particular scenario present Russia with a viable strategy, a convincing theory of success? Each scenario is explored through the perspectives of military practice or tactics, then politics, and then synthesized through a strategic perspective.

This study aimed to investigate the dosimetric characteristics of the Agility grating system in orbital lymphoma. Methods: A total of 10 patients with orbital lymphoma who underwent radiotherapy at the Ninth People's Hospital, affiliated with Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine, from 1 May 2016 to 30 May 2018 were selected. The Monaco treatment planning system was used for calculation, and the MLCi2 and Agility grating data were selected, respectively. Dynamic intensity adjustment was carried out. In the calculation, the limit of other tissues is fixed, and only the limit of the patient's affected side crystal is changed. The limit range is changed from 4 to 20 Gy. The function is Serial, and each change is 2 Gy. The whole eye, the crystal, the optic nerve, and the target area's conformal index, homogeneity index, and planned hop count were calculated, respectively. Results: With increased limitation of the affected side crystal, Agility was more advantageous in the parameters of conformal index, homogeneity index, the affected side of the optic nerve, the average amounts of the affected eye and side of the eye, and the planned number of hops. The conformal index difference rate was 27.12%. After dropping to 5.11%, the difference rate of the homogeneity index decreased from 11.52% to 1.57%, and the downward trend gradually slowed down (P < 0.01). There were statistically significant differences: the difference rate of the affected side optic nerve decreased from 11.99% to 1.53% (P < 0.01); the mean difference rate of the affected side crystals decreased from 20.59% to 3.55% (P < 0.01); and the mean value of the affected side eye was <10 Gy when the crystal limit was <10 Gy. The difference in learning was >10 Gy, and there was no statistical difference. The calculation results of the contralateral crystal, MLCi2, are more advantageous (P < 0.01), indicating there is a statistically significant difference. Conclusion: The results of Agility gratings are more dosimetric than MLCi2 gratings in the treatment of orbital lymphoma. Agility grating should be used for radiotherapy of orbital lymphoma. © 2019 The Authors.

An 80-year-old Malay man was planned for urgent major abdominal surgery following diagnosis of intestinal obstruction secondary to an advanced rectosigmoid tumour. A request of two units packed RBC was made given anticipated blood loss intraoperatively. His pre-operative haemoglobin was 135 g/L. His previous immunohaematological record showed that he had an extremely rare P2k (P1-, P-, Pk+) phenotype with clinically significant anti-P, anti-PX2, and anti-P1.

This paper contributes a new understanding of the spatial practices of South Asian communities in the city of Glasgow based on statistics and surveys. The authors aim to address the gap in literature by analysing patterns of location and trends across the city region over the census period of 2011. The study furthermore integrates a walking tour assessment generated by checklists and a recording scheme. The attributes of cultural identity, economic diversity and socio-spatial practice of six urban spaces within three selected neighbourhoods are examined. Two urban spaces were chosen from each neighbourhood to interpret the diversity of land uses along each case study and the social interaction as well as economic activities of South Asian residents. This suggests that the idea of a coherent 'Asian community' obscures differences and generates assumptions regarding residential behaviour and 'in-group' identities. The research, therefore, provides an enhanced understanding of how these distinctive communities interact with a built environment, which has not been designed to cater certain spatial practices. © 2019 Emerald Publishing Limited."

However, with advents in longer wavelengths and laser field enhancement metallic surfaces, previous simulations no longer suffice to describe more recent strong field and high yield experiments. We present a brief introduction to and some of the theoretical and empirical background of electron rescattering emissions from a metal. We set upon using the Jellium potential with a shielded atomic surface potential to model the metal. We then explore how the electron energy spectra are obtained in the quantum simulation, which is performed using a custom computationally intensive time-dependent Schrödinger equation solver via the Crank–Nicolson method. Finally, we discuss the results of the simulation and examine the effects of the incident laser’s wavelength, peak electric field strength, and field penetration on electron spectra and yields. Future simulations will investigate a more accurate density functional theory metallic model with a system of several non-interacting electrons. Eventually, we will move to a full time-dependent density functional theory approach. © 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland."

The explanation of this condition can be traced back to ancient Ayurveda text like Susruta Samhita, Ebers Pappyrus of 1500 B.C., etc. The exact cause of rectal prolapse is unclear but it is predominant on female gender and on people having constipation, previous anorectal surgeries etc. Both partial and complete varieties of rectal prolapse are extremely debilitating because of the discomfort of the prolapsing mass and variety of symptoms like rectal bleed, intermittent constipation or fecal incontinence. Although, diverse modalities of surgical management of rectal prolapse are present, no single optimal procedure is proved and the choice of operation is determined by the patient's age, sex, degree of incontinence, operative risk, as well as by the surgeon's experience. In Ayurveda, Guda Bhramsa (Rectal prolapse) is explained by Acharya Susruta under Kshudra Rogas (chapter of minor diseases) and has elaborated it's conservative management very beautifully. In this case, a female with partial rectal prolapse was treated with Kshara application and managed without complications.

Three key themes reflected the participants’ experiences when looking back at their hospitalization 3 months after being discharged: (i) A break from everything “out there”; (ii) A safety net to catch me if I fall; and (iii) From being looked after to taking responsibility for yourself. The transition from being an inpatient to returning home can be hard.

"The effect of coloured beverages on the colour stability of a flexible denture","2019","Malaysian Journal of Medicine and Health Sciences","0","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85106813459&partnerID=40&md5=2d39ef63de737696b081d887ed9b0769","Introduction: Colour stability of the material is an essential factor that contributes to the selection of a flexible denture material. Staining effects on the denture may result in unattractive appearance, the dissatisfaction of the wearer, and limited usage period of the denture. This study aims to identify the colour stability of the Valplast flexible denture material using three types of beverages. Methods: A total of 32 disc-shaped flexible resin materials (20 +/- 0.1 mm in diameter and thickness 3 +/- 0.1 mm) were prepared based on the manufacturer instructions. The samples were randomly divided into 4 groups of immersion: distilled water (control), coffee solution, tea solution and red wine. The samples were left in the specified immersion solution for up to 60 days. Colour changes were measured after 1, 3, 7, 14, 21, 30, 45 and 60 days of immersion. Results: The samples immersed in coffee solution changed from S1 to S2, whereas samples in tea solution changed from S1 to S3. Additionally, samples in red wine changed from S1 to S4, as observed using the Valplast colour tone guide. The highest reflection measured using spectroscopy was 65.146 at 385.19 nm of the control samples, whereas the lowest reflection was 1.974 at the wavelength of 385.97 nm on the samples immersed in the red wine. Conclusion: The most significant difference can be observed in the red wine group, followed by samples in tea and coffee solutions. Moreover, increasing the immersion period causes increasing staining effect of the denture. © 2019 UPM Press. All rights reserved."

The volatility is proxied by the volatility implied by the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model. We concentrate on examining the respective relationship governing the function of approximation error against the strike price step. A sample data extracted from DJIA index options data is used, which covers the period from January 2009 until the end of 2015. This study finds that the best strike price step size that asserts the most minimum approximation error by practice is a step size of $1.00. There exists a linear relationship between strike price discreteness size and approximation error. The choice of the different step size of strike price discreteness is in fact contributes to the performance of a model-free variance in approximating the real-value volatility. © 2019"

Methods: This is a retrospective study that reviewed cases collected from the surgical operations record from January 2015 to December 2017 in Hospital Tengku Ampuan Afzan, Kuantan. A total of 179 cases were collected with 110 cases fulfilling the proposed inclusion / exclusion criteria. They all underwent routine debridement followed by culture and sensitivity. Previous clinical records were traced to identify the various risk factors for infection and evaluate these against the resistance of the microorganisms to prophylactic antimicrobial drugs. Results: Admission to the intensive care unit, blood transfusion, antibiotic regime and duration, fracture grade, injury severity score and duration of admission were all significantly associated with resistance of microorganism. The study also demonstrated the predominance of Gram-negative microorganisms constituting 65.9% of isolates. Gramnegative microorganisms were seen more in higher fracture grades and Injury Severity Scale, and longer duration of admission and antibiotic treatment. The overall susceptibility of microorganisms to antibiotics was also demonstrated with up to 68.6% resistance to cefuroxime and 36.9% to Gentamicin. Staphylococcus aureus and MRSA were the commonest Gram-positive organisms while Pseudomonas and Acinetobacter spp. the commonest Gram-negatives. Conclusion: Admission to Intensive Care Unit, blood transfusion, antibiotic regime and duration, fracture grade, injury severity score and duration of antibiotics have a significant positive predictive value to the development of resistance of microorganisms. The shift to predominantly Gram-negative microorganisms indicate an urgency to modify management of open fracture to achieve optimal results. This will also prevent the emergence of new multi-drug resistance microorganism which is already a worldwide public health problem. © 2019. All Rights Reserved."

An edge uv ∈ E(G) is subdivided if we delete the edge uv from G and add a new vertex x and two edges ux and vx. The eternal msecurity subdivision number sdσm(G) of a graph G is the minimum cardinality of a set of edges that must be subdivided (where each edge in G can be subdivided at most once) in order to increase the eternal m-security number of G.

Due to the etching effect of H2O2 on the silver conductive junction which was formed by enzymatic oxidation of glucose, the charge transfer plasmon (CTP) would have a good response to glucose. Based on this, it could be applied to the detection of glucose. The relationship between glucose concentration and the intensity, wavelength of CTP peak, and surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) intensity, as well as the selectivity of the sensor were investigated. The experimental results show that the method has high sensitivity and good selectivity towards glucose. Two linear relationships were identified between the CTP peak intensity change value and the glucose concentration in the range of 0. 5~ 4 μmol/L and 4~10 μmol/L, respectively, with a limit of detection (3a rule) reaching 0. 2 μmol/ L. The naked-eye detection of glucose can reach the micromolar level. The SERS also exhibited a linear response toward glucose, within the concentration range of 1~10 μmol/L. © 2019, Editorial Department of Journal of University of Science and Technology of China.

As a result, anti-piracy, a domain of robust IP protection has become a cardinal subject of research in system design. In this regards, watermarking has emerged as one of the best protection of authorship since it provides protection against tampering without any perceivable change in the multimedia content. This research paper focuses on developing a robust watermarking scheme. The proposed approach employs quantum chaos based encryption algorithm having low time complexity and optimized entropy values thereby reducing the chances of statistical attacks. In addition, SHA-3 is used for creating the digest as it affords easier hardware implementation and high security. DCT–DWT hybrid model is used for embedding watermark to further enhance robustness and RC4 with quantum chaos coupled with neighbouring coupled map lattice sequence as key for allocating random position to watermark pixels. The scheme provides improved results against existing noise based geometric attacks, universal image quality index and visual assessments in comparison to other mechanism in literature. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG."

In such experiments, synchronizing stimuli presentation software with existing biomedical instruments, and marking EEG signals are difficult problems to overcome. In EEG experiments, these kinds of problems have been still tried to be overcome with the simple and unprofessional software like PowerPoint. Furthermore, commercial software is costly and may be incompatible with the current laboratory resources. In this study, free and simple STIPRESOFT software which could synchronize stimuli presentation software with available EEG devices and could mark EEG signals at the time of visual stimulus was developed. In the applied experiments, the time latency between the stimulus and marking times were more successful with 0.028 ms according to the competitors. In the software, the advantages of the Win-API were benefited. In STIPRESOFT, two API were exploited to improve timing precision, and to enable synchronization. Furthermore, time stamps related to stimuli on EEG signals were recorded in a text file during the experiment. Consequently, the developed software presents an alternative free and simple solution for researchers who need to adjust synchronization between stimuli presentation and existing EEG device in the scientific studies. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG."

Barefoot doctors were a special group of rural medical practitioners active in a very special socio-political context. Various editions of barefoot doctor manuals and textbooks were published across China after the first publication of the Manual in 1969. The publication of these manuals and textbooks became an indelible hallmark of the ""Cultural Revolution"" (1966-1976), when political publications predominated. The Manual was not only a guide for barefoot doctors in their daily study and practice, but also a primary source of medical knowledge for ordinary people. In the middle of the 1970s, the Manual was translated into many languages and published worldwide. This paper argues that the publication of A Barefoot Doctor's Manual embodied a public-oriented mode of knowledge transmission that emerged and was adopted during a very specific era, and though it was eventually substituted by a mode of training embedded in the formal medical education system, it demonstrated the impact of politics on medicine and health in the context of resource scarcity and low literacy. Changes in China's geopolitical status, the West's pursuit of alternative approaches to medicine and health, and the World Health Organization's (WHO's) concern over health universality and equity all contributed to the translation and circulation of the Manual, facilitating the dissemination of Chinese medicine worldwide. The paper thus presents empirical and theoretical contributions to research on the relationship between medical politics and knowledge transmission in China. © 2019, Science Press.

Its morphology (adjectival possessive compound) and the meaning of its two constituents kaví “poet” and krátu “resolve” are more or less undisputed, hence the common translation “with a poet’s resolve”. However, in spite of the rare occurrence and the apparent lucidity of the morphology and semantics of kavíkratu, such a translation may not be appropriate. The uneven distribution of this term and its marked position within the stanzas where it occurs, in combination with the semantic ambiguity of Sanskrit compounds, may be taken as an indication that this compound possesses a more intricate structure, and that this intricacy is the reason for its occurrence. In this article it is argued that this compound admits more than one translation, and that it is necessary to reproduce its semantic ambiguity in translation. Finally, the possibility of using the uneven distribution of kavíkratu to identify differences between certain groups within the Rgveda with regard to their world-views is briefly discussed. © 2019 Köhler F."

In the treatment success group, we found the success rate of around 90% with VRZ trough concentration (Ctr) of 3-4 mg/L. Eleven patients developed liver injuries (LI) and the rate of LI increased significantly with VRZ Ctr of more than 5 mg/L. Conclusion: We recommend VRZ trough concentration of 3-4 mg/L, as at this range the patients responded better to the treatment than at > 5.0 mg/L since it was associated with augmented hepatotoxicity. © 2019.

During this study, we propose a new controlling method focused specifically on the geometric parameters of infill patterns. The input parameters of this method can be used to create 3D printed objects with more lightweight interiors. The presented approach partitions a region of an object with user-specified distance inputs that are used to create infill pattern elements. Moreover, the proposed method will enable the generation of new design variations derived from a single pattern type with similar topologies and varying geometric parameters. The hexagonal pattern variations comprising regular and irregular elements have been presented. The variations of infill pattern design are useful for creating more lightweight and stronger 3D fabrications. The proposed approach is applicable for many different patterns, including linear pattern designs. The goal of this study is to devise a more cost-effective method of creating 3D-printed objects through the application of customizable infill patterns. © 2019 by the author.

The exact natural course, epidemiology, pathogenesis and clinical importance of OCI are unknown. We investigated the existence of OCI among local patients undergoing routine HD at a referral hospital in Pahang, Malaysia. Methods: Serum and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PMBCs) were collected from peripheral venous blood samples of seropositive (anti-HCV positive) and seronegative (anti-HCV negative) HD patients as well as healthy individuals (negative control group). Inclusion criteria for the seronegative patients included elevated liver enzymes. Both conventional PCR and strand-specific PCR were used to detect the viral RNA and to indicate active viral replication in PBMCs respectively. Direct DNA sequencing was done to confirm the viral HCV RNA and their genotypes. Results: In the majority (90-100%) of seropositive chronic hepatitis C patients, viral RNA was detected in both serum and PMBCs. Meanwhile, out of 22 seronegative patients, 6 (27%) showed active viral replication in PBMCs but no detectable viral RNA presence in the serum. None of the negative control group had detectable viral RNA. All seronegative patients with OCI were infected with HCV genotype 3 and two of them (2/6) had a slight elevation of their liver enzymes. Conclusion: Seronegative OCI does exist among local hemodialysis patients, with normal or persistently abnormal liver enzyme values. Further investigation is needed to study the mode of viral transmission and clinical significance of OCI in HD setting. © 2019. All Rights Reserved."

Etlingera elatior flower extract is known to have antibacterial properties however, the properties against these bacteria have not been extensively reported. Thus, this study aimed to investigate the antibacterial properties of the flower extract against these bacteria. Materials and Methods: The flower extract was subjected to sequential extraction using three different solvent polarities; n-Hexane, dichloromethane (DCM) and ethanol. The antibacterial properties were evaluated using the disc diffusion and broth dilution assays techniques by determining the inhibition zone diameter, minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC). Total phenolic acids (TPC) and flavonoids contents (TFC) were estimated using Folin-Ciocalteu and aluminium-chloride colorimetric assay respectively. Morphological changes of the treated bacteria were studied using scanning electron microscope (SEM). Results: DCM flower extract showed the highest antibacterial properties against P. acnes; at 25 mg/ml it had the widest inhibition zone (11.39 ± 0.45 mm) and the lowest MIC (6.25 mg/ mL) and MBC (12.5 mg/mL). The ethanolic flower extract had the highest antibacterial properties against S. aureus; at 50 mg/ml- the inhibition zone was 6.21 ± 0.25 mm and the MIC and MBC were both 12.5 mg/ mL. Ethanolic extracts had the highest TPC (966.304 ± 114.08 mg GAE/g) and TFC (796.33 ± 65.78 mg QE/ g). There was significant morphological changes of the treated bacteria observed under SEM. Conclusion: E. elatior flower extracts exhibited antibacterial properties against acne-inducing bacteria. © 2019. All Rights Reserved."

Identification of genus and species-specific antigens has not been successful so far. Due to lack of human adult filarial parasite, researchers have been using other adult worms like Setaria digitata, a cattle parasite or Brugia malayi, a rodent model for their research work. In this situation, specificity of the prepared antigen (S. digitata or B. malayi) to detect the antibodies to Wuchereria bancrofti is questionable. Methods: In the present investigation, we have tested a panel of human sera (collected from the areas, endemic for bancroftian filariasis) to correlate the immune reactivity against somatic antigens of adult stages and microfilarial stages of S. digitata and B. malayi. Further, using intact microfilariae (mf) from the above two parasites along with W. bancrofti, we have analyzed the antibody response to the sheath antigens. A panel of infected human and cattle sera was tested by immunoperoxidase assay using intact mf of three different parasites, viz. W. bancrofti, B. malayi, and S. digitata. Results: A very significant positive correlation in filarial Igs (polyvalent), IgG, IgM, IgE and IgG4 levels were found between the two adult somatic antigens of B. malayi and S. digitata when tested against human filarial sera. However, such a correlation was not found when mf antigens of B. malayi and S. digitata were tested against a panel of W. bancrofti sera indicating that antigens present in mf could be far less cross-reactive in comparison to those in adult stage parasites. Interpretation & conclusion: The results indicated the differential cross-reactivity of antisheath antibodies to the mf sheath of three different filarial parasites. Soluble antigens of S. digitata could inhibit antisheath antibody reactivity to only S. digitata mf sheath and not to mf sheath of W. bancrofti further confirming the specificity of sheath antigen. © 2019 Wolters Kluwer Medknow Publications.

The proposed surgical options are as follows: (1) staged procedure with elephant trunk (ET) technique, (2) traditional frozen elephant trunk (FET) intervention, and (3) beating heart cerebral vessel debranching followed by thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR). However, a marked enlargement of the proximal descending thoracic aorta might make it difficult to perform FET/ET intervention. Furthermore, because in conventional surgery for AAD, a prosthetic graft replacement is generally limited to the ascending aorta, and in repeat surgery, this short Dacron graft rarely provides enough room to allow a beating heart cerebral vessel debranching and obtaining a reliable landing zone for the implantation of a firmly anchored stent graft. Methods We retrospectively reviewed all the five consecutive patients treated in our institution, between 2014 and 2017, for chronic aortic dissection after successful surgical treatment of acute Type-A aortic dissection with graft replacement limited to the ascending aorta. The five patients underwent repair utilizing a modified FET technique with total aortic arch and upper descending aorta exclusion without touching the native dissected aorta. Results No early- or midterm mortality was observed. Mean time interval between the initial and the reoperative procedure was 26 months (range, 3-80 months). No patient had a minor/major neurologic event. Mean circulatory arrest time was 16 minutes (range, 11-25 minutes). Mean follow-up time was 22 months (range, 9-42 months). Conclusions We report our initial experience with a modified FET technique realized by anastomosing the stent graft with the previously implanted ascending aortic graft in Hishimaru's zone 0 and by rerouting all cerebral vessels without touching the native chronically dissected aorta. A larger number of patients and a longer follow-up will be required to confirm these initial encouraging results.  © 2019 by Thieme Medical Publishers, Inc."

However, the disease burden among Malaysian population has not been established. This study was aimed to determine the prevalence of goitre and its associated factors among adult population in Peninsular Malaysia. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional study was performed in 5 pre-assigned regions in Peninsular Malaysia. Participants' sociodemographic profile and medical history were recorded. Physical examinations were done looking for abnormalities of the thyroid gland and signs of thyroid dysfunctions. The diagnosis of goitre was made by palpation and corroborated by the repeat examination by another investigator. The World Health Organization (WHO) goitre grading system was used. Fifteen millilitre of blood were withdrawn and analysed at a central laboratory. Results: Among 2190 respondents, the prevalence of goitre was 9.3%. Goitre was associated with positive anti-thyroperoxidase and anti-thyroglobulin antibodies. Females were at higher risk of goitre (adjusted OR = 2.4; 95% CI 1.6-3.5; p<0.001). The other risk factors of goitre were Indian ethnicity (adjusted OR=2.0; 95%CI 1.2-3.3; p=0.006), positive anti-thyroperoxidase (adjusted OR=1.8; 95% CI 1.1-3.1; p=0.024) and living in rural area (adjusted OR = 1.7; 95% CI 1.2-2.5; p=0.002). These areas had been shown to suffer from some degree of iodine insufficiency in the past. Conclusions: The prevalence of goitre in Peninsular Malaysia was comparable with other studies. The main predictors of thyroid disorders are female gender and thyroid antibodies. Living in rural areas was associated with goitre. © 2019. All Rights Reserved."

We concentrate on investigating higher order option-implied moments â variance, skewness and kurtosis, chosen in relation to contracts defined in MFBKM, i.e. volatility, cubic, and quartic contract. The three approaches adopted in order to estimate the integrals of the defined MFBKM contracts are the basic (trapezoidal-rule), adapted (single-combined) and advanced method (cubic-spline). The sample data is extracted from DJIA index options data, which covers the period from January 2009 until December 2015. The results show that the advanced method performs poorly in estimating the MFBKM, especially in the case of skewness and kurtosis integrals estimation. The advanced method outperforms the other approaches in the case of the variance estimation. In estimating both model-free skewness and kurtosis, the adapted method is found to perform the best, instead. © 2019. All Rights Reserved."

This article examines a specific case where a scientist grappled with such an issue: the linguist Chao Yuen Ren's application of mechanical means in his phonetic studies. In the 1920s-1930s, Chao conducted a series of field and lab studies on the dialects in southern and central China. In contrast to traditional scholars' exclusive reliance on sharp ears and rhyme books, Chao employed mechanical devices to inscribe and analyze the spectrographs of dialectical tones and used phonographs to record the articulations of his subjects. It is demonstrated that Chao's machines not only provided a new method of observation; they also altered the theoretical understanding of certain fundamental categories in Chinese phonology, such as tones. Moreover, Chao did not aim to replace human perception with automatic mechanisms in empirical investigations. Rather, the use of machines in his research called for an active and engaged scientific persona. © 2019, Science Press. All right reserved."

However, typical grid sites are not fully utilized by regular workloads. To increase the CPU utilization of these grid sites, the ATLAS@Home volunteer computing framework can be used as a backfilling mechanism. Results show an extra 15–42% of CPU cycles can be exploited by backfilling grid sites running regular workloads, while the overall CPU utilization can remain over 0.9. Backfilling has no impact on the failure rate of the grid jobs, and the impact on the CPU efficiency of grid jobs varies from 0.02 to 0.11 depending on the configuration of the site. In addition, the throughput of backfill jobs in terms of CPU time per simulated event is the same as for resources dedicated to ATLAS@Home.

In a second stage, real-time simulations were performed on the SANDRA simulator at DST, to check manoeuvrability with current. Lastly, manoeuvring times were used in capacity simulations, using IMDC-Locks software (IMDC). In particular, the capacity of the secondary lock of the second layout had to be tested. All the results collected helped to choose the appropriate design for the new lock, and to optimize future operation rules. © SHF, 2019."
"Use of electronic medical records to conduct surveillance of malaria among Peace Corps volunteers","2019","JAMIA Open","0","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85103742960&doi=10.1093%2fjamiaopen%2fooz047&partnerID=40&md5=2ae53a77538d7986655ccfb80bf6c19f","Objective: The Peace Corps' disease surveillance for Peace Corps Volunteers (PCVs) was incorporated into an electronic medical records (EMR) system in 2015. We evaluated this EMR-based surveillance system, focusing particularly on malaria as it is deadly but preventable. Materials and Methods: In 2016, we administered a survey to Peace Corps Medical Officers (PCMOs), who manage PCVs' medical care, and semistructured phone interviews to headquarters staff. We assessed the structure of the surveillance system and its utility to stakeholders, evaluated surveillance case definitions for malaria, and compared clinical information in the EMR for malaria cases captured by surveillance during the first half of 2016. Results: Of 131 PCMOs, 77 (59%) completed the survey. Of 53 respondents in malaria-endemic nations, 98% believed most PCVs contact them about possible malaria. Of 134 cases with a malaria clinical diagnosis in the EMR between January and August 2016, 58 (43% sensitivity) were reported to the surveillance system by PCMOs. The remaining cases in the surveillance system were added during data cleaning, which is time-intensive. Among the 48 malaria cases identified by surveillance between January and June 2016, positive predictive value was 67%. Discussion: Areas for improvement include streamlining PCMO documentation, refining case definitions, and improving data quality. With such improvements, surveillance data can be used to inform epidemiological analysis, clinical care, health education, and policy. Conclusion: The EMR is an important tool for malaria surveillance among PCVs and, with the refinements mentioned, could serve as a framework for other multinational organizations to monitor their staff. © 2019 Oxford University Press.

In this light, design literacy becomes the cornerstone for enabling and supporting this evolutionary path. Digital technologies are expected to act as empowering agents of multidimensional human future citizens and in fostering social innovation and territorial development [1,2]. Concretizing this vision means also contributing to the reification of the United Nations Development Goals (SDGs) [3]. However, this is no easy task since, as UNESCO itself suggests, it involves questioning the future of ""places"" and learning processes, teacher education and training, learning accessibility and all actors involved and sustain social innovation. In the organic era of interaction dominated by the pervasive presence of devices and networks, achieving SDG 4 - Quality Education, one has also to take into consideration the digital world and the skills associated with it.

Total 1660 dengue cases (overall attack rate: 7/1000) and two deaths (case fatality rate: 1/1000) were reported. All age groups were affected. Out of the 213 blood samples collected from probable dengue cases and tested at Virus Unit, ICMR-National Institute of Cholera & Enteric Diseases (NICED), Kolkata, 163 (76%) tested seropositive through NS1/IgM ELISA confirming dengue infection. DENV 1 was the predominant (53%, 44/83) serotype followed by DENV 2 (23%, 19/83), DENV 4 (15.6%, 13/83), DENV 3 (8.4%,7/83). Coexistence of dengue and chikungunya virus infection was detected. Major presentation of the confirmed dengue cases was fever with headache (95%), followed by arthralgia, myalgia, retro-orbital pain, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, and rash. Abundance of vector breeding spaces was observed in the area. Accordingly the health authorities were suggested to conduct frequent mass awareness campaigns involving community to reduce breeding sources during pre-monsoon and monsoon months. Further, adult mosquito control measures were also suggested throughout the year and inter-departmental coordination was recommended for prevention of such outbreaks in future. © 2019 Wolters Kluwer Medknow Publications.

Polysemy and cognitive linguistics. The case of vána. The Poznań Society for the Advancement of Arts and Sciences, PL ISSN 0079-4740, pp. 61-72 The aim of this paper is to address the problem of the polysemy of Sanskrit words using the example of the meanings of the word vána used in the Rgveda (“a tree, wood, forest, fire drill, vessel for Soma, water and material of the world”). I will show that the methodology of cognitive linguistics is very useful to analyse the rational background of polysemy and its conceptual consistency. The basis for my analysis is three assumptions accepted in cognitive linguistics: 1. the meaning of words reflects thinking about the designate; 2. thinking is motivated by experience and cultural beliefs; 3. the associations between semantic aspects of the word can be modelled as conceptual metonymy, conceptual metaphor and conceptual blending. On the basis of these assumptions, I will reconstruct the semantic structure of the word vána. It is a radial category, the centre of which is constituted by its most literal meaning, “tree”, and its metonymic extensions, i.e. wood and forest. The meanings of things made of wood (i.e. fire drill and vessel) are also close to the central meaning and are metonymic extensions. The meanings of water and the material of the world are metaphoric extensions of the central meaning and more peripheral. They are based on cultural beliefs and models shared by the Rgvedic poets. I will also argue that the Rgvedic poets consciously shaped the semantics of the word vána by using it in contexts which forced the recipient to activate its less literal meanings. Thus they could create a general concept of the hiding place of desirable goods, such as fire, Soma, the sun, and the world. © 2019 Jurewicz J."

By focusing on women's unique calculus of risk and reward, the article not only distinguishes Chinese women's experiences from those of their male counterparts but also delineates the special contours of the Chinese case within the global advancement of women in science. The article begins by outlining some of the features and dynamics of early Chinese girls' schools that affected students' interest in and preparation for further scientific study. Then it traces the emerging college-level opportunities that made it possible for women who were studying science in China to contemplate advanced work overseas. Turning to study abroad, the article highlights the radicalness of the decision to study abroad by examining the impact of both family background and national circumstances on Chinese women's strategies of mobility. The article argues that if we are to take women's experiences seriously, we cannot just look at scientific pursuits in terms of achievements in the development of Chinese science, we also need to consider the ways that •scientific ambitions forced individuals-both male and female-to navigate and reimagine multiple social norms and expectations. © 2019, Science Press.

ECD-MS was performed for triply and quadruply-protonated melittin and its variants obtained by a single amino acid substitution, namely, D-Pro14, Pro14Ala, and Leu13Ala. Although native triply-protonted melittin showed only a few peptide backbone cleavage products, the D-Pro14 and Pro14Ala variants exhibited extensive backbone fragments, suggesting the occurrence of a significant structural or conformational change induced by a single amino acid substitution at Pro14. On the contrary, the substitution at Leu13, namely Leu13Ala (+3), did not cause significant changes in the ECD backbone fragmentation pattern. Thus, the sensitivity of ECD-MS is demonstrated to be good enough to probe the aforementioned conformational change in melittin. © Korean Society for Mass Spectrometry."

This project also looks into the Master of Science (MS) program in the Department of Physics at Yenching University, which, founded in 1927, was the first graduate program in physics in China. It was this MS program that transformed the Yenching Department from a largely premedical training center serving the PUMC into a prominent cradle of Chinese physics research. This Yenching Department, despite its small faculty and brief existence, nurtured many eminent Chinese physicists, such as Chao-Ying Meng 孟昭英, Wen-Yu Chang 张文裕, Ming-Chen Wang 王明贞, Chia-Liu Luke Yuan 袁家骝, Cheng-Shu Wang (Chang) 王承书, Ho-Fu Lu 卢鹤绂, Ting-Sui Ke 葛庭燧, Kun Huang 黄昆, and Chia-Lin Hsieh 谢家麟.

In this paper we search the presence of such structures, which we call (almost) bicomplex structures, associated to bicomplex numbers. However, we can see that bicomplex numbers don’t present a relation with the (almost) bicomplex structures because bicomplex numbers can be defined only in 4n-dimensions even though 2n-dimensions are sufficient to define the almost bicomplex structures. Two examples for 4- and 6-dimensions show clearly this result. Finally, the integrability conditions for these structures are investigated. © 2019 A. Razmadze Mathematical Institute of Iv.

In a continuous and undisturbed sediment archive, the results of this method are reliable as shown by various studies. However, depending on the specific characteristics of an archive provided by alluvial sediment, the results might be unreliable or biased. This article describes the challenges and ambiguous results obtained by the measurement of radiocesium in a soil profile that provides a time marker with a concrete structure of known age. The applicability of radiocesium for the study area was successfully tested on a floodplain profile. The results showed radiocesium peaks up to 22.5 Bq/kg that correspond to the years 1963 and 1986. As a result of different hydromorphological conditions and sedimentation rates at the sampling locations, the peaks occurred in different depths. In the floodplain, the 137Cs-peaks are significantly more distinguished than in the profile at the concrete structure. There, the radiocesium content is scattered, which queries the function of the structure as a chronological marker. The scattering might be caused by various syn-sedimentary and post-sedimentary processes and factors, such as scouring and redeposition of contaminated sediment, topsoil recycling by vegetation uptake and dieback, or input of eroded sediments from the hinterland forest soils. Thus, the concrete structure creates and at the same time destroys the possibility of using it as a chronological marker. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG."

The purpose of this work is to investigate the dependence of the structural features of the low-temperature photo luminescence (LTPL) spectra with the lattice parameters of wideband semiconductors and binary materials. A decoding method of the LTPL spectra of the binary polytypic structures of SiC was used. As a result, we introduce here for the first time a new i-unit atomic parameter of energy scale for the LTPL spectra of binary polytypic nanostructures. The i-unit parameter equals 4.3 meV, i.e. which equals 1/2 of the distance between adjacent Si–C layers and gives the exact multiples of the basic spectral parameters to tenths of meV. The i-unit of energy scale allows the simplifying method of spectral analysis of fine structures in SiC polytypes. The proposed new atomic i-scale allows us to monitor the processes of phase transformations up to 0.0787 Å. This allows observing the displacement in tetrahedron of silicon and carbon with dimensions 7.56 Å. The introduction of a new energy parameter makes it possible to control the displacement and position of atoms with very high accuracy, which in turn is very important for understanding the nature of defects in semiconductors. It is shown that phase transformations in SiC are related to dislocation in the crystal and implemented by the deformation and diffusion mechanisms. Due to results the diagram of the interlayer scheme radiative recombination with resulting dislocation levels was introduced. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG."

This may lead to adverse effects, such as diabetes, hypertension, stroke, cardiovascular risk and kidney problems due to inappropriate self-prescription. This study was performed to determine the prevalence of herbal and dietary supplements usage among patients with chronic kidney disease and its association with the socio-demographic background and the conventional medication adherence. Materials and methods: A survey was conducted among 78 chronic kidney disease patients attending the Nephrology Clinic, Hospital Tengku Ampuan Afzan, Kuantan, Pahang. Data were collected using a questionnaire and analyzed using descriptive statistics, Chi Square Test and Fisher's Exact Test. The p-value was set to be less 0.05 for its level of significance. Results: Most of the patients aged more than 50 years (89.7%), female (53.8%), unemployed (41%) and from lower socioeconomic earners (75.6%). Only 5.2% of respondents reported using herbal and dietary supplements. There was no association between socio-demographic background with the herbal and dietary supplements usage. Similarly, there was no association between herbal and dietary supplements usage and the conventional medication adherence.

Spencer Island Regional Park is part of the tidal freshwater wetlands along the Snohomish river basin. Those wetlands are part of a complex ecosystems, in which they are included as a salmon corridor. This research analyzes the vegetation community changes over time after restored in 1996 on Spencer Island Regional Park, Everett, Washington State, U.S. I analyzed three spectral indices using segmentation and supervised classification of land cover from 1997 to 2018. I found that in the last 21 years, the areas with emergent palustrine vegetation and forests increased, in contrast to diminishing areas of upland and scrub-shrub classes. Those finds can be interpreted that the community vegetation advanced to higher wetland successional stages as upland areas have been colonized by emergent wetland plant communities. A linear regression model predicted that by 2025, the difference between emergent and upland classes should increase. Empirical evidence is presented that support the integration of spectral indices to identify changes in community vegetation. However, it is recommended for future studies to include spectral indices and spatial information for soil and hydrology to deepen these results. © 2019 Sciendo. All rights reserved."

In spite of various advantages of LTP ionization method, including simple instrumentation and in-situ analysis, more general applications of the method are limited due to poor desorption of analytes with low volatilities and low ionization efficiencies in the negative ion mode. In order to overcome these limitations, an ultrasonic vibrator of a commercial hand-held humidifier was interfaced with an LTP ionization source, which generated microdroplets from sample solutions and assisted with LTP ionization. Ionization behaviors of various chemicals in microdroplet-assisted LTP (MA LTP) were tested and compared with typical LTP ionization from dried samples applied on a surface. MA LTP efficiently ionized small organic, amino, and fatty acids with low volatilities and high polarities, which were hardly ionized using the standard LTP method. Facile interaction of LTP with ultrafine droplets generated by ultrasonic resonator allows efficient ionization of relatively non-volatile and polar analytes both in the positive and negative ion modes. © Korean Society for Mass Spectrometry."

One great advantage of this technique is that the ostia of the SAV remain free from a cannula, allowing the operator easier access and a faster anastomosis or reimplantation.  © 2019 by Thieme Medical Publishers, Inc."
"A low latency MAC protocol for underwater sensor networks considering bi-directional communication in multi-hop and multi-flow scenarios","2019","SN Applied Sciences","0","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85100753882&doi=10.1007%2fs42452-019-1567-0&partnerID=40&md5=825f8bd9576facb9de16abfb8e4f76e6","Underwater Acoustic Sensor Network (UW-ASN) is a remote system comprising of spatially disseminated independent gadgets utilizing sensors to screen physical or natural conditions underwater. Regular MAC protocol is not adequate in underwater acoustic sensor systems (UW-ASN) due to high error rate and long propagation delay for the general attributes of the physical media. In this research work, a Bidirectional Multi-Flow MAC protocol (BMF-MAC) for UW-ASN is proposed in order to manage multi-hop and multi-stream data flows so different flows of data transmission continue at the same time while modifying by fluctuating traffic state. The proposed protocol provisions structure of multi-hop streams, contrary to other underwater MAC protocols, by considering each pending packets in directing layer support. All stream setup request from neighbors while setting up a stream. So as to complete the execution investigation of the proposed BMF-MAC protocol, an experimental model is designed, which incorporates the condition of energy utilization, throughput, end to end delay and frame error likelihood. Comparative performance analysis has been done between the proposed protocol and the contemporary Cascading Multi-jump Reservation and Transmission protocol and performance is analyzed in terms of throughput, end-to-end delay, and energy utilization. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG."

The drinkable water must be free of unusual taste, odor, and turbidity and of constant chemical composition, with no pathogenic microorganisms and toxic substances. Materials and Methods: To assess the fulfillment of the World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations for the drinkable water, a cross-sectional study has been carried to investigate the quality of drinkable water provided by the public system, in which samples have been taken throughout 92 days period (October, November, and December). Some of the most important qualities such as the physical parameters (turbidity and temperature) and chemical parameters (total chlorine, free chlorine, combined chlorine, total dissolved solids [TDS], and pH) were examined in situ by the use of portable digitized devises. Results: The statistically significant difference was absent (P > 0.05 [NS]) in comparison with turbidity and TDS before and after filtration in water treatment plant. There was an irregularity of both total and free chlorine concentrations in the study months, minimum = 0.33 and maximum = 2.00 ppm and minimum = 0.00 and maximum = 1.80 ppm, respectively. The total chlorine difference was highly significant (P < 0.001) between October and November and November and December. There was a clear decrease in temperature (the mean in December was 15.358°C than October and November). In addition, the maximum degree was in October = 35.70°C while the minimum degree was in December = 12.60°C. There was a decrease in mean value of pH from October, November, and December (8.096, 7.988, and 7.591, respectively). The turbidity and TDS test results are showing an increase in the values all over the time of the study 4.197, 5.189, and 5.55 NTU and 948.047, 980.51, and 939.07 ppm, respectively. Conclusion: The study concluded that from all parameters that were tested in the present study, the unsuitability water provided by public system for human consumption. © 2019 JPR Solutions.

A sample of 100 palm containers from online museum collections was then compared with this literature to analyse key attributes including: general descriptions, distribution, functions, raw materials/species used, manufacture methods, styles, decoration, traditional names and other aspects of cultural importance. The research revealed that these objects of material culture were/are made from a single palm sheath, which is either folded and stitched or scrunched and tied forming an impermeable container that is easily transported. Palm containers were/are primarily used to carry water or a mixture of water and honey, to sustain children and adults while gathering food, however they were/are also multi-purpose. Results demonstrate that palm containers are distributed from at least Shoalhaven in southern New South Wales, north along the coast to the ‘Top End’ of Australia, including the Torres Strait Islands and on to Cygnet Bay in Western Australia. Six botanical species were/are used to make palm containers across Australia, with Archontophoenix cunninghamiana and Gronophyllum ramsayi being the most commonly used. Six styles of palm containers are identified and available Indigenous language names have been collated. © 2019, Anthropological Society of South Australia. All rights reserved."

Materials and Methods Identification of the gender of the skull was performed based on established criteria. Analysis for closure of skull sutures (cranial and facial) and measurement of orbitomedial (OM) and maxillomedial (MM) facial anthropometric lines were undertaken to provide an estimated age against each examined suture, as well as against a group of sutures through established scoring systems. Furthermore, the approximate height of the individual was estimated from the skull length using regression equations from a reference adult Indian male population. All of the measurements were made on the digital images of the skull using a digital image analyzer (Image J software, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA). Results Established criteria confirmed that the skull was of a male individual, and the skull sutures and age related morphological changes in the bones indicate that it belonged to an individual in an age range between 20 and 50 years old, with an average of 30 years old, and an approximate height between 5 feet 8.2 inches to 6 feet 1.3 inches. Conclusion The observed values are in approximation with those mentioned in historical notes, and slight differences may be attributed to gross reporting of the original values or limitations of anthropometric analysis. Further biological tests will be required to validate the identity beyond reasonable doubt. © 2021 Georg Thieme Verlag. All rights reserved."

There are three test domains that are considered in this paper, i.e., a square, a circle, and a parallelogram. In our numerical test, the eigenvalues disperse as the power of the variable coefficient in- creases. Not only that, we also note that the dispersion of the eigenvalues corresponds with the characteristic size of the test domains. It enables us to predict the convergence of an iterative method. This is an advantage as it enables the use of an iterative method in solving Dirichlet Bdide as an alternative to the direct methods. © 2019. All Rights Reserved."

In addition, colours have senses specific to particular fields, from physics over printing to senses used in everyday life. In the present article, I carry out an analysis of the colour term white in English, and its counterparts in Russian, Tajik and Uzbek from the lexicological and lexicographical point of view, starting with a semasiological perspective, following Steinvall's (2002: 56) methodology. The conceptual space of the colour term white in lexicographic work tends to be kept compact rather than articulated in great detail, just like in the case of other types of colours, i.e. in an attempt to minimize polysemy, its senses are typically lumped, rather than split. The main aims were to investigate the differences in the representation of adjectives denoting white colour across languages and to compare monolingual and bilingual dictionaries with respect how they structure their meanings, as well as collocations and idiomatic expressions (often based on metaphors and metonymies). A number of field-like clusters of concepts related to the colour terms for white were established. Based on these findings, I proceed to make some suggestions for the improvement of the approach to colour terms for white and other colours in general use and pedagogical dictionaries. © 2019 Daler Zayniev, published by Sciendo 2019."

Leaching PG in aquatic environments would cause a significant decrease in dissolved oxygen, and this is the main reason for treatment of runoffs and wastewater contaminated with this pollutant. Previous researches on PG removal from wastewater indicate that biological methods are more economically suitable. Therefore, a new biological reactor was introduced and used for the treatment of wastewater containing PG. Two main approaches for increasing removal efficiency in presented research are utilizing two serial lab-scale Sequencing Batch Reactors and feed backward connection between these reactors. This novel reactor was named Feed Backward Serial Sequencing Batch Reactor. Moreover, response surface method was used for modeling of PG treatment and investigation of interactions and simultaneous effects of independent parameters. Retention time, influent COD, and flow recirculation percentage were considered as independent variables, where COD removal efficiency was the dependent variable. According to the results, the best COD removal efficiency was 47%, and it was achieved in 3.52 h retention time, 1667.76 mg/L influent COD, and 23.33% flow recirculation percentage.

The experiment was laid out in randomized complete block (RCB) design with split plot arrangements. There were two factors i.e. Phosphorus levels and dates of Sowing. Phosphorus levels were assigned to the main plot while sowing dates were kept in the subplot. The data on Number of branches plant1, Days to flowering, Days to fruiting, Number of fruits plant1 and Yield Plot1were significantly affected by phosphorus level and date of sowing. While the data on plant height was not significant, and overall results showed that early sowing date (February 25) produced significantly good results as compared to the rest of the sowing dates. Moreover, phosphorus level was also significantly affected the experimental parameters. Phosphorus level (70 kg ha1) produced significantly best results in all the parameters followed by Phosphorus level (100 kg ha1) in almost all the parameters.

Áhir budhníyah and bhūmidundubhih: The serpent of the deep and the earth -drum. A hypothesis of etymological and/or cultural connections. The Poznań Society for the Advancement of Arts and Sciences, PL ISSN 0079-4740, pp. 107-131 This article highlights how the process of semantic extension applied to the OIA onomatopoeic noun dundubhí, usually meant as “drum”, is the token of significant cultural changes: especially within ritual performances, such as the mahāvrata rite, gradually canonised in the Brahmanical ritualism, it turns out to be a device to promote a new model of sovereignty, related to the establishment of the so-called Kuru-Pañcāla realm. Such a cultural transformation, carried out in the Middle and Late Vedic period in northern India, entailed that ancient Indo-European tribal cultural traits were intermingled with cultural substrate/adstrate elements: the term dundubhí is “etymologically” connected to the Proto-Munda *dub-/*dum- “to be swollen, roundish”, the PAA *duby-/*dub- “tail, buttock, animal limbs”, and Middle Iranian isoglosses meaning “tail, extremities, fat-tailed animals”. Moreover, as bhūmidundubhi “earth-drum” beaten on the border of the ritual area in the mahāvrata rite, representing earthly sonority and the “mighty bellowing” of cattle, it is associated with the IIr myth of valá/vará, the “enclosure”, in which the treasure/cattle “endowed with rock as foundation” (ádri-budhna, RV 10.108.7ab), is hidden. The related lexicon and imagery recall mythical archetypes, such as the Serpent of the Bottom (OIA áhir budhníyah, Gr Pythô ophis) or primordial Monster of the Deep (Gr Typhôn/ Typhôeus), and BMAC interferences are also embedded. However, although linguistic evidence confirms the etymological relationship between the OIA budh-ná and the Greek pythmên, the case of the Greek Typhôn/ Typhôeus seems more uncertain: the IE reconstruction *dhubh-/*dhub “depths” is considered a secondary outcome, and cannot be convincingly applied to the term dundubhí, because of its onomatopoeic nature. Nonetheless, as an outcome of linguistic and cultural interferences, “Sanskritised” within the ritualism, which supported the paradigm of the Kuru-Pañcāla sovereignty, the term dundubhí conveys the double “redundant” value of deep/high sonority and swollen/roundish abundant prosperity, to which the figure of Brhaspati is correspondent: in RV 10.64.4 he is defined as the kaví tuvīrávān “poet endowed with powerful bellowing”, which announces prosperity, spreading it loftily, throughout the cosmos. © 2019 Rossi P.M."

This multivariable analysis of a previously reported claims-linked, cross-sectional survey assessed symptom burden measured by the COPD assessment test (CAT) in patients treated with LAMA monotherapy. Methods: Eligible patients aged ≥ 40 years with COPD (≥ 2 International Classification of Diseases-10th Revision-Clinical Modification [ICD-10-CM] diagnosis codes ≥ 30 days apart during the 12-month baseline period) and ≥ 2 claims for LAMA monotherapy in the latter half of the baseline period were identified using claims data from the Optum Research Database. Patients completed a survey and 7-day daily diary; baseline clinical characteristics and resource utilization were assessed from claims data. Association between symptom burden and baseline characteristics was assessed using generalized linear regression modeling with normal distribution and identity link. Results: Overall, 433 patients prescribed LAMA monotherapy with claims-linked survey and diary data were included in the analysis. Most patients (85.5%) had a mean CAT score ≥ 10; 39.0% had scores ≥ 21. Overall, the factors most related to a clinically meaningful increase in CAT score (≥ 2 points) were being diagnosed with COPD for > 5 years and being a current smoker (2.25 points, P = 0.003 and 2.22 points, P = 0.025, respectively). Conclusions: Results demonstrate that many patients with COPD receiving LAMA monotherapy remain symptomatic, especially those diagnosed > 5 years ago or those who continue to smoke. Use of patient-reported outcomes such as the CAT should be considered part of routine visits for patients with COPD.

Most nonhuman animals living in groups also engage in behavior patterns fitting the above definition.

We describe and evaluate a knowledge-driven method that identifies whether a patient meets a selected set of 13 eligibility clinical trial criteria from their longitudinal clinical records, which was one of the tasks of the 2018 National NLP Clinical Challenges. Materials and Methods: The approach developed uses rules combined with manually crafted dictionaries that characterize the domain. The rules are based on common syntactical patterns observed in text indicating or describing explicitly a criterion. Certain criteria were classified as “met” only when they occurred within a designated time period prior to the most recent narrative of a patient record and were dealt through their position in text. Results: The system was applied to an evaluation set of 86 unseen clinical records and achieved a microaverage F1-score of 89.1% (with a micro F1-score of 87.0% and 91.2% for the patients that met and did not meet the criteria, respectively). Most criteria returned reliable results (drug abuse, 92.5%; Hba1c, 91.3%) while few (eg, advanced coronary artery disease, 72.0%; myocardial infarction within 6 months of the most recent narrative, 47.5%) proved challenging enough. Conclusion: Overall, the results are encouraging and indicate that automated text mining methods can be used to process clinical records to recognize whether a patient meets a set of clinical trial criteria and could be leveraged to reduce the workload of humans screening patients for trials. © The Author(s) 2019.

Through its visual, structural and deductive approach; FTA is able to depict the temporal sequence of events and their interactions in a formal and logical hierarchy. Materials and Methods: Employees with permanent standard threshold shifts (PSTS) underwent further assessment confirming the presence of NIHL. A single common fault tree was constructed based on six cases of PSTS. The top event is the PSTS. Intermediate and basic events were identified and mapped with relevance to the provisions in the FMA (noise) 1989 indicating how failed control measures have resulted in the PSTS cases. Results: The constructed fault tree with its branches illustrated how breach or noncompliance of FMA (Noise) 1989 resulted in the eventual top event (NIHL). Conclusion: FTA provides a standardized perspective of errors within the system in preventing NIHL. © 2019. International Medical Journal Malaysia. All Rights Reserved."
"Entomological status of Anopheles sergentii and the first molecular investigation of its insecticide-resistant genes, kdr and ace-1 in Morocco","2019","Journal of Vector Borne Diseases","0","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85097121308&doi=10.4103%2f0972-9062.302033&partnerID=40&md5=ff1cd2cf04ba10d613c69f6d436e5284","Background & objectives: Prior to their elimination in 1974 and 2004, respectively, Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax were the main native malaria parasites involved in disease transmission in Morocco. Imported cases of human malaria are still reported from the country. Anopheles labranchiae in northern Morocco and An. sergentii in the southern regions are the main malaria vectors. The bionomics and insecticide susceptibility of An. sergentii are poorly understood and need to be further studied to enhance the epidemiological surveillance of this important malaria vector. Methods: The adults and larvae of Anopheles sergentii were collected during the mosquito breeding season in 2015 and 2016 and environmental characteristics of their breeding sites were recorded. Blood meals were analyzed using PCR-RFLP. Alongside, the WHO routine susceptibility tests with DDT (4%) and malathion (5%) were conducted and An. sergentii specimens were screened for knockdown resistance (kdr) and acetyl cholinesterase encoding (ace-1) gene mutations. Results: Anopheles sergentii was observed during the summer and autumn seasons, feeding mainly on sheep, cows and also on humans. The WHO bioassays revealed complete susceptibility to DDT and malathion. Analysis of the sequences of the voltage-gated sodium channel gene revealed the absence of the kdr 'Leu-Phe' mutation and PCR-RFLP revealed the absence of the G119S mutation in the ace-1. Interpretation & conclusion: With the increasing number of imported cases of human malaria in Morocco, the indiscriminate feeding behavior of this species may pose an infectious medical threat. Fortunately, the absence of insecticide resistance can ensure, for now, the efficiency of insecticides, as a part of the vector control program in controlling An. sergentii in Morocco. © 2019 Wolters Kluwer Medknow Publications.

The activation, hold, and relaxation phases of the gastrocnemius muscle were monitored for maximum voluntary isometric contraction. Muscle belly shortening occurred during contraction and a post-contractile overshoot (lengthening) and subsequent exponential recovery of muscle dimension to the baseline were observed. Both the overshoot and recovery are attributed to the muscle as suggested by combined monitoring including electromyography and modelling with a lumped mechanical circuit containing idealized elements, such as a bidirectional linear motor unit, a ratchet, dampers, and springs. The rapid contraction and relaxation phases require a high-order filter or alternatively a kernel filter, attributed to the nervous system as suggested by external electric stimulation, which resulted in faster rise and relaxation times. The respective response function is modelled with an electrical lumped circuit. Together with empirically adjusted reaction times and corrections for droop in the hold phase, the monitored response is represented in close approximation by the combined electrical and mechanical lumped circuits. The refined combinatory model includes a ratchet as a novel nonlinear mechanical element. In combination with determined model parameters, it provides a refined evaluation scheme capable to model monitored muscle dynamics in physical activity in close approximation. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG."

This article considers the escalation of violence against ethnic minorities during the early period of Myanmar’s democratic transition in the context of the claim that transitional justice has the potential to deter future atrocities. First, the article explains why the military, the democratic opposition, Western states, and the United Nations (UN), all accepted that Myanmar’s democratisation should proceed without the establishment of institutions and processes of transitional justice. Second, the article shows how, in the absence of transitional justice, the transitional government attempted to bolster the rule of law by conducting its own investigations into allegations of misconduct by the military and through low-level prosecutions of individual military officers, and explains why this strategy failed. Finally, the article considers the potential impact of recent efforts at the international level to establish accountability, such as the UN Human Rights Council’s establishment of an Independent Investigative Mechanism for Myanmar, the International Criminal Court (ICC) proceedings related to the crime against humanity of deportation, and the case bought by Gambia in the International Court of Justice (ICJ) for Myanmar’s violation of the Genocide Convention. © The Author(s) 2020."

The European Central Bank has recently launched the first phase of the TRIM, which investigates the ability of banks’ internal risk models to adequately capture tail risk in underlying portfolio items. Against this background, using empirical examples, this paper reviews statistical tools for validating the assumption that a given risk proxy (in this case, an equity index/fund benchmark) adequately represents tail risk in the returns of an individual asset (in this case, equity/fund). Our paper reviews the following validation tools for comparing the return distributions of the proxy and the underlying assets: the Kappa coefficient, the paired t -test and the two-sample Kolmogorov–Smirnov test. In doing so, this paper shows the shortcomings of using certain statistical tools to assess the ability to capture tail risk. The motivation of this paper is to advise on specific aspects of the validation practice that have grown in importance under the TRIM framework but remain under-researched, with no academic studies explicitly advising on the validation of the risk proxy assignment.  © 2019 Infopro Digital Risk (IP) Limited"

If the foundation depth and bridge pier piles are insufficient, the bridge will fail. Now, due to the importance of identifying the mechanisms affecting the scouring on this types of bridge piers, the effect of the geometric shape of the piles that installed under the inclined piers and also the effect of the pile cap leveling in the sedimentary bed have been investigated and the properties of the scouring around the inclined pier group was studied numerically and using the Flow-3D software. The study of total shear stress in the flow bed at different leveling of the pile caps shows that of the highest shear stress was created when the pile cap position is at the same level with the river bed and by installing the pile cap at a lower level than the river bed, the maximum shear stress decreases. This may be due to the fact that in this case the distance between the pier group increases and the presence of the second pier decreases the flow rate in the pier group and different pier in the one pier group act as the two Independent piers in the formation of flow pattern. By comparing the final longitudinal sections of the scouring at different leveling of the pile cap, it is concluded that the largest reduction in scouring depth occurs in aerofoil-shaped pile caps and pile caps with the sharper nose and better aerodynamic shapes are good options to control the horseshoe vortices and will reduce the scouring depth around the inclined pier group. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG."

Another objective of this research is to create a methodology to develop the intensity map for Sylhet with the equation readily available. Sylhet is Bangladesh’s most seismically susceptible region owing to its location in the southeast portion of Dauki fault. In the last 101 years, almost 184 massive earthquakes in the Sylhet area have taken place between the magnitude of 4 and 7.2. Among these earthquakes, the 1918 earthquake of Srimangal was selected as it was the first one to be felt and recorded in Bangladesh as a destructive earthquake. The probable intensity map for the Sylhet city of Bangladesh using Geographic Information Technology has been made considering the 1918 Srimangal earthquake as a scenario case. For this purpose, 157 boreholes data were collected to calculate the shear wave velocity. The SPT-N value of most of the borehole data is as deep as 15 m. Then it was converted to the required amount at a depth of 30 m. In addition, Shear wave velocity was also converted to the Peak Ground Acceleration using McGuire equation. The highest Amplification Factor was used among the three equations for converting the Peak Ground Acceleration into the Surface Acceleration. Finally, the Surface Acceleration has been converted into the Modified Mercalli Intensity scale to make it simple to comprehend. The findings show that the minimum and maximum Peak Ground Acceleration are both 0.164 g and 0.175 g, and the Amplification Factors vary between minimum and maximum from 2.027 to 3.40. Also, surface acceleration ranges from 0.347 to 0.578 g. The intensity is estimated at 27 wards in the city of Sylhet. This demonstrates that 81.48% of the intensity IX areas are impacted and 18.52% of the intensity VIII areas as a scenario case for the Srimangals 1918’s earthquake. Since the town of Sylhet does not have an intensity map, this research aims to prepare a map for all Sylhet wards. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG."

The objective of the study was to compare the clinical spectrum and laboratory profile among severe Plasmodium vivax, P. falciparum and mixed malaria patients admitted at a tertiary care center in southern India. Methods: This prospective, observational study was done in adult patients with severe malaria hospitalized in a tertiary care centre in southern India. Malaria was diagnosed by either quantitative buffy coat test or peripheral blood smear. In the cases of P. vivax malaria, an antigen detection test was done to rule out coexistent falciparum infection. Severe malaria was defined as per the WHO guidelines. The malaria severity score (MSS) was calculated for all patients based on the clinical features and laboratory parameters. Results: A total of 204 cases of severe malaria were studied. Among them, 105 (51.5%) had vivax infection, 30 (14.7%) had falciparum and 69 (33.8%) patients had mixed malaria. The mean age of the study population was 39.8±15.7 yr. The majority were males (71.6%). Hypotension and prostration were the most common complications noted in the patients, irrespective of species. The maximum mean MSS was found to be highest in falciparum malaria, followed by mixed malaria and vivax. In vivax malaria, majority of patients (71.4%) had one or two complications and only 28.57% of patients had three more complications, whereas in falciparum malaria, the majority (53.33%) had three or more complications. Around 44.93% of mixed infection malaria patients had three or more complications. The number of patients with multi-organ dysfunction (>2 complications) was significantly more in patients with falciparum infections compared to the remaining patients. Interpretation & conclusion: Severe malaria in south India is predominantly due to vivax. Hypotension and prostration were the most common complication of severe malaria irrespective of the plasmodium species. The entire spectrum of severe malaria complications described for falciparum are seen in severe vivax malaria. © 2019 Wolters Kluwer Medknow Publications. All rights reserved."

The double-resonator periodic structure is printed by a 3D printer. In the double-resonator periodic structure, the low-frequency bandgap is realized in the case of a small size with a relatively hard matrix material. Both simulated and experimental results show that the double-resonator periodic structure does ensure the realization of local resonant bandgap in the range of lowfrequency. Therefore, it can be predicted that locally resonant bandgap can be realized in the range of even lower frequency by using softer materials, while the unit cells are kept in the same size. © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd."

The cascaded structure are composed of a multimode interference (MMI) employing multimode fiber (MMF) and a Mach-Zehnder interference (MZI) employing triangular four core fiber (TFCF) with a spiral structure. Under the condition of continuous arc discharge, the spiral structure is realized by torquing TFCF. The spiral structure assisted the MZI has the ability to sense torsion and identify the direction. The ultra-high torsion sensitivity is due to the modified Vernier-effect, which is generated due to the spatial frequency difference between the MMI and MZI. The MMI acts as the reference interferometer, and the MZI with spiral structure act as the sensing interferometer. Weused the Gaussian function to filter out the envelope frequency component. The inverse fast Fourier transform (IFFT) is used to recover the envelope spectrum. The values of sensitivity magnification can be tuned by changing the length of the TFCF.

For a comprehensive study of Stewart’s Arthurian Romance, the descriptive and historical methods in the collection and systematization of language material are applied. The study also reviews some elements of analysis and synthesis. The author of the article has made an attempt to specify the genre of Stewart’s Arthurian Romance and analyse the main characters of the novels (Merlin, King Arthur, Mordred), with particular attention being paid to the place names that are considered from historical, geographical and linguistic points of view. The novels straddle the boundary between the historical novel and the fantasy genre. It is proposed to employ the new term ‘historical-fantastic novel’ to define the genre of the Arthurian pentalogy. M. Stewart combines a traditional idealization of the Arthurian legend, a detailed historical setting, and a vivid form of characterization. The novelist proposes the realistic depiction of Merlin: he is an ordinary human, having the visionary ability, but not a magician. Stewart’s King Arthur is definitely idealized and portrayed as a wise politician and a fair ruler. Mordred is depicted as a pawn of fate following the path of self-destructive behaviour. In the novels native Celtic and Latinised Celtic toponyms are used along with modern English geographical names. © 2019 Shanghai Normal University. All rights reserved."

Here, however, we explore the relationship between IQ and voting behavior at the level of U.S. counties (approx. n = 3,100). We find that county-level IQ weakly predicts more votes cast for Republicans (r's.07 to.13) and less votes cast for Democrats (r's -.10 to -.14). These small relationships are also found in multiple regression analyses, even when demographic data, social status, and population density appear as covariates (3 - 4% points more votes cast for Republicans per standard deviation of IQ). The effect of general social status was opposite that of intelligence (6 - 9% points less votes cast for Republicans per standard deviation of social status), which is surprising considering the very strong positive correlation (r =.77) between IQ and social status. Additionally, racial homogeneity by itself predicts voting Republican; however, when other variables are present in the regression model, homogeneity predicts voting Democrat. Results indicate that aggregate-level relationships between intelligence and voting outcomes are more complex than previously thought. © 2019 Ulster Institute for Social Research.

It sheds inspiring light on those events enriched with nuances and penumbra of the velvet revolutionary wind of changes that suddenly but peacefully touched the capitals of Central and Eastern Europe in the autumn of 1989. A puff of the wind of changes has gathered tons of political and intellectual material, which has been masterfully used by Berman in his reflections. He succeeds in not only providing a plausible and thought-through interpretation of both periods of excitement and utopia, but also in envisaging their subsequent developments. The perspective he elaborates is valuable and useful for any critical recollection of the half century that has passed and, perhaps, for some uncertain but hopeful glimpses at the decade to come. In his precise diagnosis of the social and political status of global humanity after the two revolutions up until 1994, Berman, with sparing eloquence, observes: “The world feels this: humble, skeptical, anxious, afraid, shaken.” (338). This diagnosis seems to lack any kind of prognosis but still comes close to Andre Glucksmann's “corkscrew” history with no clear outcome or end, and is a far cry from Francis Fukuyama's “kaleidoscopic” history crowned with the famous Last Man (257). © 2019 International American Studies Association.

From the perspective of structural engineering, this is accomplished through reducing the mass of aircraft components and structures. Advanced manufacturing techniques offer new avenues for design, enabling more complex structures which can have highly tailored properties. One advanced manufacturing concept is the use of 3D printed polymer preforms that are coated with nanocrystalline metal through electrodeposition. This enables the use of high-performance materials in virtually any geometry. To exploit this manufacturing approach, it is incumbent to have well-established mechanical models of the behavior of such hybrid structures. In particular, hybrid polymer–nanometal structures tend to fail due to compressive instabilities. This paper describes a model of local shell buckling, a typical compressive instability, as it applies to hybrid polymer–nanometal structures. The analysis depends upon the Southwell stress function model for radially loaded solids of rotation, and couples this with the Timoshenko analysis of local shell buckling. This combination is applicable to a range of practical configurations for truss-like hybrid structures. © 2019, Shanghai Jiao Tong University."

The objectives of this study were to observe the trends in tax avoidance practices in manufacturing companies in Indonesia and to examine the influence of earnings management, proportion of independent commissioners, and audit quality toward the possibility of companies in reducing tax costs. The practice of tax avoidance is measured by the Cash Effective Tax Rate (CETR) as it is not affected by changes in estimates such as valuation allowance or tax protection. Aggressive practices in minimizing the tax burden still occur in Indonesia, but this study showed encouraging evidence since the trend of tax avoidance practices is gradually decreasing. The result of testing factors which affect tax avoidance that the variable proportion of independent directors was proven to be able to reduce the action of reducing the tax burden, thus independent party supervision needed to be improved. The government needed to enforce regulations through increased transparency and disclosure, closing the loophole on taxation rules, and raising awareness for taxpayers through improving tax policies and increasing accountability for channeling tax funds. © 2019, by ASERS® Publishing.

Previously published articles dealing with optimal order quantity with permissible delay in payments assumed that the supplier only offers the retailer single trade credit period. In fact, most suppliers frequently offer retailers (or customers) a two trade credit period to attract new retailers (customers) from their competitors. In this paper, the retailer faces a progressive interest charge from the supplier. If the retailer pays the outstanding balance by the grace period (say, M), the supplier does not charge any interest to the retailer but if the outstanding amount is paid after M, but by N (with N > M), then the supplier charges the retailer the lower interest rate of Ic1 on the unpaid balance. If the retailer pays the outstanding amount after N, the supplier charges the regular interest rate of Ic2 (with Ic2 > Ic1). We first establish an appropriate EOQ model for a retailer when the supplier offers a progressive interest charge, and then provide an easy solution procedure to the problem. We also provide numerical example to illustrate the proposed model and sensitivity analysis is also carried out. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.. All rights reserved."

Although electronic contracting has been thoroughly analyzed by scholars, there still remain some issues which need to be addressed. In our view, the most essential question raised by electronic contracting is whether there is a need to amend substantial contract law provisions with regard to peculiarities of contracts formed by electronic means. Seeking the answer to this question the UNCITRAL developed several basic approaches which come down to the idea that there is no need to amend substantial contract law provisions and create a special regulation for electronic contracting. However, a lot of countries have deviated from this approach and amended some special rules. In this article the latest amendments of contract law provisions in the CIS countries as well as the provisions on contract formation which remained untouched are critically analyzed. Based on this analysis the following conclusion is made: the principles of functional equivalence and technology neutrality are still applicable to practice of electronic contracting. However, the ‘contract law neutrality’ approach should be carefully rethought since in some cases there is a need to adapt current contract law provisions to the new realm and new practices of contract formation. © 2019, by ASERS® Publishing.

The specimens were made of carbon-epoxy prepreg E722-02 UHS 130-14. Two variants of specimens were tested: Samples undamaged and samples with damage that was centrally introduced by a drop-weight impact, as per the ASTM D7136/7136M standard. An impactor with potential energy equal to 15J and the type of support required by the standard were used. The size of impacted damages, defined as an area of damage on a plane perpendicular to the impact direction, and the equivalent diameter were specified using the flash thermography method. The tests were performed using the fixtures manufactured according to the ASTM D7137/7137M standard. The specimens were compressed to determine the residual strength. This value was afterwards used to specify the force levels for the fatigue tests. The fatigue tests were carried out under force control-with a sinusoidal shape, stress ratio R equal to 0.1 and frequency f 1Hz. Maximum force in a loading cycle Pmax was being increased after each thousand of cycles N until its value was close to the residual strength determined in the previously mentioned tests. In this work, the following relationships were presented: Force-displacement P-δfor both static and fatigue tests and displacement-loading cycles δ-N for fatigue tests. A method of conducting the fatigue tests of CFRP composite was proposed, in which both the CAI specimens and CAI fixture were used. This allowed researchers to accelerate making initial comparisons between the two groups of specimens with damages-grouped relative to the way of conditioning. © 2019 Marta Baran et al., published by Sciendo 2019."

We find both aspects in the Latin treatises on agriculture, which were appreciated and carefully handed down by posterity. The authors – Cato, Varo and Columella – not only gave technical advice in their works; they also provided religious precepts while offering social, moral and philosophical recommendations. This is clear evidence of the wide culture, the commitment and the global vision that were shared by these authors.

In the first experiment, the effects of 15% M. oleifera leaf meal (MoLM) inclusion in the diet on the plasma ghrelin and IGF-1 levels were determined using four sexually mature gilts with indwelling catheter. Results showed that plasma ghrelin and IGF-1 levels between the control and experimental groups were not statistically different, although pigs fed with MoLM had apparently lower baseline and higher amplitude of plasma ghrelin levels particularly a few hours right after feeding time. On the other hand, IGF-1 level in pigs fed with MoLM seemed down regulated. The second experiment aimed to know the effects of supplementing 15% MoLM on body condition and sow productivity during the week of gradual feed withdrawal prior to farrowing. A total of 16 sows with 141 piglets were used. Although the experimental group registered higher values, the difference in backfat losses from the control group is not statistically significant. The same results were observed for the corresponding piglets; despite higher weaning weight and average daily gain, the control group was not statistically different from the experimental group. The results showed the potential of 15% MoLM in improving sow productivity through ghrelin – GH/IGF-1 metabolic pathway. Further studies are recommended with longer duration of supplementation. These are also recommended to isolate the potential component in MoLM that improves milk production because the high fiber in MoLM possibly contradicts ghrelin release in the stomach. © 2019, College of Agriculture and Food Science, University of the Philippines Los Banos.

Otherwise, production drifts towards what we can name “productivism”, that is a production subordinating every people and everything to its increase, by stressing both human and natural resources. Cultivating is actually a composition of production and generation, whereby generation can be made easier and completed by production, on condition that production itself does not arrive to an absolute denial of generation. Consequently, we have to deal with the question about the technology, to gain control of the opportunities offered by technological devices, especially in the case of their steady appliances to human body.

A number of research studies point out the fact that the processing of hard, difficult to machine materials like nickel superalloys, reveals more than one trend of residual stress versus working parameters of behaviour (Lavella and Berruti, 2010). Many papers have shown that the residual stresses are dependent on a combination of a number of factors. When the above is taken into account simultaneously with the requirements of the internal General Electric specification for the fatigue tests samples preparation (Metallic test specimen preparation, low stress, 2017) the problem of turning and grinding parameters gathers significance. It is well known that the quality of the surface layer, produced during machining, is of vital importance for the fatigue life specially for the components of aircraft produced form nickel superalloys e.g. Inconel 718 (Kortabarri et al., 2011). That is why the surface layer's properties are described in detail by the standards.

It delves into Occasion for Loving (1963) and The Late Bourgeois World (1966) to compare the status of these women with men, black and white. Their gender roles and relations are taken into consideration in an attempt to figure out inner capacities to challenge the patriarchal practices, at all levels, inherent in South Africa. Embarrassment in their case comes not from the fact of being females but rather from belonging to the white race.

Through the fictional narrative of her protagonist, Firdaus, El Saadawi unravels how the institution of marriage, in the Arab-African socio-cultural tapestry, has been tailored to serve the phallocentric order in which women are trained to make up for the desire of men. This, at times, results in their rebellion against social and familial norms thus pushing them into homelessness and prostitution. Similarly, psycho-sexual violence against the female child makes her fear her own sexuality — a fear which often culminates in the genital mutilation of girls, especially in the Egyptian rural culture. Such oppression against women, in private and public spaces, is bound to affect female psychology which, in turn, leads to tragedies like the one experienced by Firdaus in El Saadawi’s narrative. © 2019 Shanghai Normal University.

"Exploring an innovative evaluation method to ensure the quality of spatial data needed at the distribution stage: focused on building and road map in South Korea","2019","Spatial Information Research","0","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85092009830&doi=10.1007%2fs41324-019-00282-0&partnerID=40&md5=2f3965744b079ea33559a07c21b5de31","This paper aimed to suggest a method to evaluate the quality of spatial data in order to increase the interoperability of national geospatial data. The national geospatial data is managed by the government and is provided to the public according to the Spatial Data Industry Promotion Act. Although the quality control is necessary in the every processing steps including data production, processing, distribution, and service. This paper focused data quality only on the distribution stage. The evaluation rules suitable for national geospatial data were derived by comparing and analyzing domestic and foreign standards for data quality. Then, the quality diagnosis were carried out using commercial software. Two diagnostic methods were applied to test data quality. One is ‘Layer-based Approach’ that requires a comparison between two layers and the other is ‘Geometry-based Approach’ that diagnose feature geometries in a single layer. The diagnostic methods have been applied to the building and road layers in Seoul. In conclusion, this paper presented the standard quality evaluation rules and criteria that could be applied immediately for spatial data distribution industry, although some of items checked by direct visual inspection. Later, it is expected all quality evaluation rules are fully automated. © 2019, Korean Spatial Information Society."

The paper elucidates the characters’ places of origin i.e. their birthplace, places where they spent their childhood and on the other their ancestors’ homeland i.e. their ancestral place. The past of the characters situated in diaspora plays a pivotal role. The correlation between one’s place of origin and ancestral place produces the “place of memory” which weighs heavily on the present-day lives of the characters. Having been immigrants in another land, the places of memory grant the characters identity and roots. Hence, their memories are often so powerful that they by and large return to the specific places. They create their own space in which they attempt to make the most of their lives.

The analysis of glider-accident statistics shows that such out-landings may significantly influence the safety. Therefore, of vital importance are the crashworthiness properties of the glider fuselage structure. The subject of the study was the PW-5 glider fuselage made of composites and subjected to high loads typical of glider crashes. The aim was to provide experimental data for validation of a numerical model of the cockpit-pilot system during impact. Two experimental tests with the composite glider cockpit were performed using a typical car-crash track. During the first test the cockpit with a dummy inside was crashed onto the ground at the angle of 45 degrees at a speed of 55 km/h. Accelerations and deformations at chosen points in the cockpit as well as signals coming from the dummy sensors and forces in the seat belts were recorded. The second test was an impact into a concrete wall at a speed of about 80 km/h. The full-scale tests were accompanied by a number of quasi-static and dynamic laboratory tests on samples of composite material. The experimental tests provided valuable results for the parametrical identification of a simulation model developed using the MADYMO software. © 2019 Łukasz Lindstedt et al., published by Sciendo 2019."

Traditionally, such societies value cultural adherence very highly. This sometimes includes a total disregard of women's rights, in opposition to the ongoing cultural evolution in the form of modernization and globalization which is affecting these societies. Women are seen as part of the inheritance to be handed over from one man to another through marriage when the first husband dies. There is no consideration of women's emotional state during and after the mourning period. Women are required to remain part of the dead husband's family forever. These beliefs and practices infringe upon the women's freedom of choice. The reason to conduct the present study is the observation that conflicts frequently arise within families because the younger generation does not adhere fully to what traditional culture prescribes. I use two Lokshin Bioskops (short films) to show that levirate marriages are outdated from the filmmakers' modernist perspective, in large part because they violate women's rights. Furthermore, Lokshin Bioskops represent a platform for cultural evolution in a modernizing society through their portrayal of contemporary life and their advocacy against traditional practices that deny women their autonomy. © 2019 Ulster Institute for Social Research.

Ælfric's grammatical metalanguage, comprising loan words, semantic loans, loan translations, and periphrastic expressions created for explanatory purposes, is characterized by great diversity. A question arises whether these terms, remaining occasional, made any impact on the language system and can be thus evaluated as change from above. The paper combines a traditional semantic, morphological, and functional description of Ælfric's terminology and its consideration within the frame of sociolinguistics; the analysis is supplemented by a cross-linguistic study of Ælfric's terms with remarks on other Germanic languages. The results achieved enable us to argue that Ælfric's linguistic terminology, being innovative, displays some features of change from above, arising from language contact and individual change. © 2019 Sciendo.

Different magnitudes of impact loading were also applied. The study was primarily conducted experimentally with some additional numerical studies completed to further understand the results. The impact force as well as strain along the tube were measured for all described test conditions. Their results were compared. Additionally, the vibrational frequency and damping of the system were examined using strain–time histories.

The speaker’s approach to this system is always automatic because the formulas do not have autonomous evidence from sign, but only intuitive intellectual evidence, suggested by socio-cultural habits acquired.

The Second Payment Services Directive (‘PSD2’) forces some payment schemes to open up their networks to any banks that want to use them. These rules, together with a wealth of related and ancillary provisions, are the legislative fallout from a series of antitrust investigations into Visa and Mastercard. But the rules are not limited to Visa and Mastercard, nor are they limited to schemes that operate in the same way as Visa and Mastercard. They extend to payment schemes with no interchange fees at all and with tiny market shares. One argument made for including all schemes within the scope of the rules was to create a level playing field for competition. Instead, regulation that was initially aimed at Visa and Mastercard has created high entry barriers and hamstrung the only realistic challengers to these four-party schemes. If rival schemes are unable to offer customers or merchants something different, all payment services will become commoditised. Without meaningful rivals, the duopoly of Visa and Mastercard will become more entrenched and customers will see a reduction in choice and innovation.

The proposed transistor incorporates a more realistic situation and utilizes three level interference model, a novel concept which yields better transistor performance. Analytical expression of the transmission is obtained using three site energy model and the transfer characteristic of the proposed molecular transistor is investigated. Two different transistor configurations are considered, namely the central molecule directly coupled to the gate lead and isolated by a gate dielectric. The closed form expression for the voltage at which the transistor turns OFF, an important design parameter, is also obtained. Then, performance comparison is done between the two proposed configurations by varying the coupling energy between the side group states and the leads. It is shown that the dielectric separated central molecule configuration has much lower subthreshold slope than present day MOSFETs and much higherON/OFF current ratio than the four level interference based molecular transistor. Finally, the application of the obtained analytical expressions is demonstrated with an example of logic inverter design.

This paper aims to improve the trapped field by changing the size of soft-iron yoke, which are generally used to extend the pulse width. When a φ60-mm GdBCO bulk was magnetized using φ64-mm and φ80-mm yokes, the maximum flux density and total magnetic flux of large yoke were 13% and 23% higher than those of small one, respectively.

Although much attention has been given to the unusual assemblage of human remains recovered from these sites, there has been less analysis undertaken on the vast amount of archaeofauna from the caves. This is in the process of being rectified through the recent work of the Covesea Cave Project, under direction of Ian Armit and Lindsey Büster and currently being undertaken at the University of Bradford. This report details attempts to confirm species identifications for several faunal bones of interest through various methodologies; unfortunately, not all of the attempts were successful. However, identifications are confirmed for two avian bones using comparative osteological analysis at the Avian Anatomical Collection at the Natural History Museum at Tring, United Kingdom. These species are placed in context through consideration of previous excavations at the Covesea Caves, as well as recent literature on ornithological analyses of ritual and funerary sites in Later Prehistoric Britain. © British Cave Research Association 2019"

Each public authority sets the goal of its activity to improve the quality of life of the population and optimize work of the state institutions system. In this regard, the relevance of the study is determined by the fact that the current model of power delegation is determined by the regulations, which are still based on command and administrative management methods. The novelty of the study is determined by the fact that the authors disclose the possibility of delegating power not only in the aspects of introducing an outsourcing system into the public administration sector, but also in the aspects of establishing a system for increasing the efficiency of government bodies in general and civil servants. The paper shows that the basis for increasing the effectiveness of the state management system in a country where the main idea is to increase the social well-being of society should be the opportunity to increase the competence of civil servants. The practical significance of the study is determined by the fact that the use of developments is possible in the structure of globalization of the public administration system. In this case, it is advisable to consider the possibility of stratification of international systems for assessing the competence of civil servants. © 2019, by ASERS® Publishing.

The legislative development for e-business and e-commerce in Kazakhstan has begun since 1999, a number of legislative regulations and guidelines have been developed by national parliament of Kazakhstan. The purpose of this article is to present and analyze viewpoint on current national legislation and guidelines on e-business and e-commerce in post-soviet Kazakhstan. This article uses comparative method of legal rules governing e-business and e-commerce issues between Kazakhstan and international countries. Furthermore, it applies a system method, where e-business and e-commerce was considered as a co-economic-legal phenomenon in the mutually agreed existence of its main components such as e-document circulation and e-economy. The article concludes that there is no clearly nationally formulated concept of legal regulation of e-business and e-commerce, there is no clear terminology base and uniform usage of terms, a clear idea of how and what should be regulated. Also, this research highlights that Kazakhstan needs to apply integrated approach with further revision of national legislation and guidelines considering experiences of developed countries and standards of the United Nations convention on the use of electronic communications in international contracts.

It unfolds the beneficial effects that the statutory obligation to draft such plans had on the rationalisation of groups’ structure and on US G-SIBs insolvency preparedness. However, the detailed analysis of those plans also shows how banks have almost uniformly chosen a Single Point of Entry (SPOE) resolution strategy which may not be rapid and orderly and may not be the most effective strategy overall given the location and the type of entities covered. This leads the author to argue that the choice of an SPOE may be the preferred option of the relevant US Agencies, leading to a phenomenon of ‘regulatees’ capture’. The paper also shows how in case of insolvency of a US based G-SIB with entities located in the EU, tensions may arise with the relevant EU authorities. This is mainly because of the uncertainty driven: by non-uniform triggering events; by the existence of two types of resolution plans in the US; by the over-reliance on pre-positioned loss absorbing capital at group level (which may not overcome the double leverage problem); by deficiencies in US law to deal with the liquidation of G-SIBs under an SPOE; and by a possibly different regulatory culture in the US and the EU which may afford dissimilar degrees of protection to bank stakeholders. © 2019, T.M.C.

Materials and Methods: A questionnaire consisting of 12 facial photographs of cases with dentofacial deformity or malocclusion in varying severity was used. A hundred individuals were selected to answer the questionnaire. The perception of facial appearance (FAS), treatment need score (TNS), and knowledge regarding dentofacial deformity were used for the evaluation. Results: Significant differences were found between dental and non-dental when the respondents' knowledge in all the questionnaire items ([Formula: see text].05) was assessed. However, no significant difference was found in the mean of FAS and TNS in all the presented cases (normal, borderline, severe). Pearson correlation between perceived FAS and TNS was statistically negative for severe and normal cases, whereby a decrease in FAS for severe cases showed an increase in TNS, and an increase in FAS for normal cases showed a decrease in TNS.

In the University of the Philippines Los Baños, decay fungi from wooden canopies of the Baker Memorial Hall were identified and their degrading ability was evaluated. Specimen collection was conducted on degraded canopies made of Mayapis (Shorea palosapis) with signs of white or green fungal growth. Fungi associated with the rotting symptoms were isolated, purified, characterized and identified. Colonies of fungal isolates were fast-growing in malt extract agar (MEA), with colony diameter reaching 5.60 ± 0.43 cm (WRF8) and 5.15 ± 0.25 cm (WRF5) after a day. Mycelia of isolates were hyaline and rhizoidal on water agar. Isolate WRF5 produced green, raised colonies that imparted yellow pigmentation on potato dextrose agar (PDA) and MEA. Generally, colonies were raised, radially striated with green center and white margin on PDA. Average length and width of WRF5 conidia were 3.19 ± 0.33 µm and 2.73 ± 0.36 µm, respectively. Cross-referencing morphological and cultural data with related literatures and identification keys indicated the isolated fungi were Trichoderma viride (WRF1), T. crassum (WRF3), T. reesei (WRF5), Rhizopus sp. (WRF8) and Coniophora sp. Furthermore, inoculation of 108 T. reesei conidia per mL on clean Mayapis wood blocks resulted in profuse fungal growth, with average weight loss recorded at 8.81 ± 0.79% at 8 wk and 10.53 ± 0.88% at 14 wk which indicated a considerable but slow wood degradation. © 2019, College of Agriculture and Food Science, University of the Philippines Los Banos.

In the same way, the late 1990s UNICEF project «European Monetary Union and Children», directed by one of us, surprised a number of commentators. What on earth have children to do with EMU they asked? These days, after the Great Recession in 2008 and the sovereign debt crisis in 2011, the economics profession is perhaps more prepared to think through the consequences for different groups in the population of a major change in macroeconomic policy: notwithstanding their continued use, representative agent models are growingly challenged by macroeconomic models with heterogeneous agents that may allow for distributive effects as well as for the impact of distribution on macro-dynamics. But as Tony Atkinson wrote in the introduction to this paper, which formed part of the UNICEF project, macroeconomics in OECD countries at that time had tended «to become a remote and abstract subject, discussed in aggregate terms which seem far removed from the everyday experience of families». Tony set out to rectify matters, taking children as the focus, asking what is the impact of the introduction of a single European currency on Europe’s children? Despite its apparently simple and non-academic tone, this article was in many ways typical of Tony’s style. To tackle a substantive question such as EMU and children, he turned to standard off-the-shelf macroeconomic models and asked what they could say, indicating pitfalls and limitations but also suggesting fruitful research developments. This is the case, for instance, in his reference to EUROMOD, an EU-wide tax-benefit microsimulation model which was then in its infancy and has by now become a standard tool for the European Commission’s policy analysis (www.euromod.ac.uk). An apt example is the «EUROMOD simulations of the impact of the reduction of childcare costs on the use of the service and on the mothers’ labour supply decisions» which appears as Annex 2 in the last Employment and Social Developments in Europe 2019, a flagship publication of the European Commission Directorate-General for Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion. The same publication reports for the EU, the Euro Area and each Member State the «share of children living in low work intensity households», which is an example of the child-focused unemployment rate advocated by Tony. Other suggestions have been less successful: to our knowledge, no European price index for families with children has been developed so far. Tony’s article is also exemplar of his deep views. Tony constantly paid attention to the conditions of children in his research. And he was a true European who strongly believed in the construction of the European Union. In this article, he managed to bring together these two concerns calling for «humanising the debate about EMU» – a much needed call, with hindsight. He returned to children and the EU in Inequality. What Can Be Done?, published two years before his death, where he proposed the introduction of a participation income at the national level «with the prospect of an EU-wide child basic income», which he conceived of as the first step in an initiative towards a participatory income at the European level (Atkinson, 2015, 222-223). As noted, this paper was part of the UNICEF project and was published as a UNICEF occasional paper (Atkinson, 1998). (Other papers in the project were Micklewright and Stewart, 1999; 2000; 2001). Two decades after its writing, its publication in a journal is appropriate and timely. It is a good way to pay tribute to Tony by publishing it in Politica Economica – Journal of Economic Policy, a journal on whose Advisory Board Tony sat until his premature death in 2017. It is a thoughtful way to celebrate, but also reflect upon, the two decades of the European Monetary Union, with the hope that learning from past errors may help to push forward the European process.

The experience of European countries in the field of anti-forestalling regulation is analyzed. It was found that anti-forestalling measures are divided into four types, such as: cap on tax stamps, cap on release for consumption, sell-by date, paying the tax difference. It has been found that in some countries of the EU optimal antiforestalling regulation has been achieved over a period of time, in several stages and through the introduction of several measures at the same time.

The latter, when met, allows high admissible differential gain of the INA, which in turn, is expected to give a desirable high Common Mode Rejection Ratio (CMRR). However, the use of conventional passive RC high pass filters at the input greatly reduces CMRR. This work intends to design an improved AC coupled input circuitry for INA giving high CMRR and high input impedance. A differential RC high-pass input circuit has been developed using an active element. It creates an effective high resistance for the common mode current but provides a low resistance path to input bias currents for normal operation of the INA. Between 1 Hz and 100 Hz, CMRR of the DC coupled INA (LT1167) was 115 dB, using a well matched traditional RC coupling, 55 to 95 dB, while it was 110 dB using the improved active AC coupled circuit. This improvement was practically demonstrated through Electrocardiogram measurements from a human subject. A novel active AC coupling circuitry has been proposed and developed giving high CMRR, very close to the maximum of an INA, which is non-varying within the frequency band of interest of Bioelectrical amplifiers. The developed input circuit will improve all bioelectrical measurements in the future.  © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd."

The conductivity changes of three metal oxide sensors(ZnO (S1), In2O3 (S2) and SnO2 (S3)) with different analytes(hydrogen (A1), formaldehyde (A2) and hydrazine (A3))were measured using in-house developed instrumentation and is sent to PC to store the sensor data for discrimination of analytes using pattern recognition technique. The data acquisition software collects the data in PC to train the data for discrimination of analytes using pattern recognition tool in real time. The various features of sensor response were derived from the response curve and the Principal Component Analysis(PCA) algorithm was implemented in software to extract the information from sensor response data for discrimination of analytes.

In my fieldwork with the Senoi Temiar peoples in Malaysia, there is also a belief in other world journeys. In addition to the other world, there are issues addressed in terms of applying Shakespeare with children with special needs as well as troubled teenagers and adults.

Premodern peoples regard dreams as real-life incidents their souls see or participate in at night. Dreams are seen as true travels the soul makes at night. Therefore, dream incidents have almost the same reality status as the incidents happening at daytime. What the body makes in daytime the soul does at nighttime. Both universes – the visible and the invisible world – are likewise real. More, they are intertwined with each other. Developmental psychology can explain the prevalence of the realistic dream understanding in premodern societies and its stepwise annihilation in modern societies during the past centuries. Dream understandings are not modules separable from psychological stages but are their inevitable manifestations. As modern human beings attained higher psychological stages during the past centuries, stepwise from generation to generation, as they replaced their realistic by subjective dream understandings. © 2019 Angelo Pontecorboli Editore - EDK.

The uncontroversial medical standard of care for this population's treatment includes avoiding, minimizing, or intentionally treating pain, and this standard has evolved due to the data of multiple lines of research. While it is true that unsettled debate over how to best define “pain” continues, this debate does not change the fact that premature babies' outcomes are better when what seems to be painful stimuli is removed or treated. Thus there is an uncomfortable paradox between the current standard of care for neonatologists, and what remains legal for obstetricians to do to the same patient.

Methods: Four hundred seven boys and 158 girls diagnosed with β-thalassemia major, aged 1 to 20 years and getting regular blood transfusions, were half yearly measured for crown-heel length (height) and crown-rump length (sitting height) using a mixed-longitudinal research design. Manouvrier's Indice Skelique ((standing height sitting height) / sitting height) × 100 was used to categorize patients into brachyskelia (up to 84.9), mesatyskelia (85.0 - 89.9), and macroskelia (≥90). Results: Transfusion dependent β-thalassemia patients grew normally in height up to 10.0 years. Thereafter, curves ran below the 3rd percentile of CDC standards making 49.2% of males and 47.9% of females short-statured. Predominance of macroskelia (male: 85.3%, female: 78%) over mesatyskelia (male: 14.7%, female: 22%) was recorded. Macroskelia amongst short statured patients was due to truncal shortening. Conclusions: Thalassemia patients exhibited compromised growth and short stature beyond 10 years of age. The macroskelia type of body proportionality in the majority of the thalassemia patients is mainly due to truncal (sitting height) shortening. © 2019 Ulster Institute for Social Research.

Miniaturisation is achieved by increasing the metallic strips to form EF-structure resonator. Commercially available, the advanced electromagnetic simulator has been utilised for the layout design and elaborated analysis of this developed left-handed metamaterial. The unit cell structure is embedded in low-cost FR4 dielectric substrate and size of the metamaterial is 11.11 × 11.11 mm2. Due to the miniaturised size, a highly effective medium ratio of about 14.82 is obtained. The developed left-handed metamaterial exhibits negative permittivity, negative permeability, and negative refractive index over multiple frequency ranges. Nicolson-Ross-Weir (NRW) method has been utilised for the extraction of the effective parameters. Thus, a novel metamaterial has been presented where the miniaturised size and its performances makes it compatible to use for the applications of 1.82 GHz, 2.22 GHz, 4.82 GHz, 5.89 GHz, 10.54 GHz, i.e. for digital cellular system (DCS), earth exploration-satellite communications (EESC), lower band 5G mobile communications, WiMAX applications, and military satellite applications, respectively. Furthermore, the metamaterial has average SAR reduction of about 44%. These results proceed to a guideway of better SAR reduction of modern electronic communications. © EDP Sciences, 2020."

This lack of research limits the evidence base on which instructors can draw to inform their teaching. A key starting place for education research about evolutionary topics is determining what concepts are important for undergraduates to learn. This work develops a community-informed list of key concepts about speciation. Speciation is commonly taught in undergraduate biology education, yet has been the focus of almost no research on teaching and learning. We gathered input from over 110 evolution educators and speciation researchers to create a compre-hensive list of speciation concepts for undergraduate education. Results: The community-informed list includes 24 concept statements organized within 4 overarching concepts. At least 80% of experts rated these statements as scientifically accurate and clear. Over 90% of experts rated the statements as important or somewhat important for a graduating senior in biology to understand. Conclusions: This list provides a foundation for both education researchers and evolution educators. Education researchers who investigate student thinking and who develop research-based measurement tools can use this list to determine key concepts on which to focus their future work. Educators can use this list to guide the development of learning objectives for speciation instruction. Future work should investigate what concepts are reasonable for an undergraduate to master in a 4-year degree. © The Author(s) 2019."

Due to the imperial distortion of African history, the people were made to believe that they need civilisation, salvation, and reconstruction. The colonisers had to convince Africans that all that emanated from the continent was filled with ‘darkness’ and therefore needed to be civilised, reconstructed and humanised by Europe. African myths and religions suffer from this deceptive move by the Europeans and the gods are often relegated to being wicked and unjust. In this paper, which attempts to correct such erroneous beliefs, the focus is on Ogun, the Yoruba god of war, who has been subjected to mistaken identity by scholars, researchers and critics. It is against this backdrop and misrepresentation of Ogun that the authors delink from the notion that the god is a vengeful and obstinate god. They conclude that Ogun is not a god who engages in reckless devastation of life, as is commonly argued in literature criticisms of the Ogun figure, but a god who seeks justice when wronged. Decolonial thought and its view on ‘unthinking’ Eurocentric epistemologies on Africa are used to unpack Ogun’s characteristics as a god of justice in Ododo’s Hard Choice. © 2019 Shanghai Normal University.

This is because legalized violence, whether in threat or in deed, constitutes the very antithesis of peaceful relations from the point of view of those whom law represses. Law cannot define peace as the absence of all violence-and still less as the absence of all legalized suffering-without gainsaying justice, for as Pascal says, “Justice without might is helpless; might without justice is tyrannical.” Although legal outcomes, like falling boulders and pouncing lions, can always be imputed to historical causes, experience teaches that legal actors generally seek to legitimate their deeds by grounding the law in some non-causal narrative of the right or the good. According to a tenet of political liberalism that can be traced to Descartes’ discovery (or invention) of the irreducible “I” that thinks, the legitimacy of law’s narrative is both given and taken by free and rational politico-legal subjects.; In truth, however, the Western philosophical tradition gives us two separate grammars for discussing what it takes to be two different kinds of rational subjects: the causal subject and the grounding subject. The causal subject stands in a relation to the world. Acting strategically as the cause of effects, it uses the object world and other human beings as means to its ends. But the causal subject is also itself caused: its desires and actions are effects of history in the largest sense of the word. Such a one is fated by grammar and custom to become an object and a means in its own right: an object for scientific inquiry and knowledge, for example, and, more generally, a means to the ends of other causal subjects. From the standpoint of the causal subject, there can be no human right not to use or be used as a means.; Unlike the causal subject, the grounding subject is supposed to be a genuine origin rather than a mere link in an infinite chain of causes and effects. In Greek terms, this subject is an archē as opposed to an aitia. It also corresponds to the original Latin meaning of the word “sub-ject”: it is thrown (jacere) under (sub) its world as (not in) an unmediated relation to its projects. This second kind of subject has gone by many different names, including “soul” (Plato), “freedom” (Kant) and “Spirit” (Hegel). In one way or another, the idea of the grounding subject performs its primary task within the moral sphere: it is supposed to provide a secure foundation which explains how it is possible for its doppelganger, the causal subject, at once to accomplish something in the world and to refute Plautus’s notorious argument that man is wolf to man. If the causal subject reacts in the manner of an animal, then the grounding subject allegedly responds in the manner of an animal rationale. If the causal subject produces effects, then the grounding subject is supposed to create and bear responsibility for those effects.; Given the foregoing distinctions, the most pressing juridical and moral question facing twenty-first century humanity seems to be: How can law and politics become at once effective and just, coercive and compassionate, responsive and responsible? How, in short, is it possible (to borrow Kant’s somewhat quaint terminology) to use oneself and other human beings simultaneously as ends and as means? But here, as elsewhere in philosophy, appearances can be deceiving, for this question presupposes far too much.; This paper investigates the strong connection between the foregoing concepts of subjectivity and the notion of a just peace. The question is not, “Are there rational subjects and can they found something new, such as a just peace?” Instead, the question at the heart of the matter is how something as flimsy and ephemeral as an “idea” could ever found anything at all. I will attempt to unmask the terrible tensions or contradictions between justice and ethics, freedom and responsibility, and reason and compassion, and trace them to their origin: the will (or desire) to deny tragedy. I claim that the concept of the grounding subject represents a desperate and ultimately futile attempt to repress awareness of (and) evade personal responsibility for the essential sadness and tragedy of the world. Reason and faith provide the human body with a thin tissue of grounding statements comprised of symbols and images. At best these symbols and images are mere stimuli: action-triggers that will never adequately span the vast existential distance separating the grounding subject from the causal subject, our ends from our means, our words from our deeds, and, more generally, human suffering from the endless secular and religious casuistries we offer to justify it."

Finally, we discuss typical examples of development of patterns and characteristics of English that have been analyzed as influenced by change from above, as well as the prestige dialects / languages and contexts that have been regarded as facilitating a hypothesized change from above (Latin, Anglo-Norman, standardization, prescriptivism, networks and individuals). We argue that the articles of the present special issue provide stable criteria that are required in any attempt to test the hypothesis of change from above in the development of English. © 2019 Sciendo.

"Dynamics of capital structure, risk-taking behavior, and profitability across the vietnamese banking system: Evidence from a panel vector autoregression","2019","Journal of Advanced Research in Law and Economics","0","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85093876251&doi=10.14505%2fjarle.v10.8%2846%29.25&partnerID=40&md5=5bfa86539ae9b030b2a345064e0f47b4","The paper examines the interdependence between the profitability, risk-taking behavior, and capital structure across the Vietnamese banking sector, using panel vector autoregression with quarterly data of the 22 banks over 2014Q1–2019Q3. The outcomes indicate profit or solvency shock increases leverage, while the profit and solvency respond negatively to the leverage shock and their movement over time path is pretty similar. This reflects that the insolvency risk is sensitive to the wellbeing volatility due to the weak capital. Moreover, the forecast variance in the leverage is mainly predicted by the profitability shock, while that of solvency is by the leverage one. The estimated variance in prosperity is mainly explained by the inefficiency shock. Thus, regarding policy recommendations, in the long run, Vietnamese financial regulators need to be continuously consistent with capital strength-supporting policies. However, other policies facilitating an effective financial environment are also simultaneously established to help banks minimize operating costs for higher management efficiency and thereby profitability. This supports the banks to partially offset the negative impact of increased capital which might reduce their profitability. Finally, strengthened supervision policies are also necessary, especially when the banks are more profitable because they intentionally relax borrowing and leverage restrictions. © 2019, by ASERS® Publishing.

The Szekelys, who fled from Transylvania after the massacre of Madéfalva (1764), had lived for almost two centuries in five villages in Bukovina, a province of the Austro-Hungarian Empire until 1918. Bukovina became part of the Kingdom of Romania after the First World War, and the Szekely villages became overpopulated and suffered from the increasing Romanian nationalism. Plans to resettle the Szekelys of Bukovina date back to the 19thcentury when a special act was made, but only a few thousand Szekelys left Bukovina. Hungary and Romania signed an international treaty in 1941 on the resettlement of the Szekelys from Bukovina to Hungary. The settlement was an element of the forced rehungarization of the Vojvodina region occupied by Hungary in early 1941. The migrants of the state enforced settlement action received an evacuation order in October 1944 and came as refugees to the todays Hungary. They were settled in Baranya und Tolna counties in 1945 in the houses and land properties of Danube Svabians. © 2019 Iuris Universal Ediciones. All rights reserved."

Materials and methods: We used gynandromorphs, experimentally modified wild-type (Oregon-R) females, and mutant females that lacked different components of the female reproductive apparatus. Results: Many of the gynandromorphs mated but did not expel the mating plug (MP). Some of these — with thousands of sperm in the uterus — failed to take up sperm into the storage organs. There were gynandromorphs that stored plenty of sperm but failed to release them to fertilize eggs. Expelling the MP, sperm uptake into the storage organs, and the release of stored sperm along egg production are separate steps occurring during Drosophila female fertility. Cuticle landmarks of the gynandromorphs revealed that while the nerve foci that control MP expelling and also those that control sperm uptake reside in the abdominal, the sperm release foci derive from the thoracic region of the blastoderm. Discussion and conclusion: The gynandromorph study is confirmed by analyses of (a) mutations that cause female sterility: Fs(3)Avar (preventing egg deposition), Tm2gs (removing germline cells), and iab-4DB (eliminating gonad formation) and (b) by experimentally manipulated wild-type females: decapitated or cut through ventral nerve cord. © 2019, Akadémiai Kiadó Zrt."

The Ga l i o-Ca r p i n e tum oakhornbeam-forest was supposed to be a remnant of the (sub-) climax vegetation of the Northern Munich gravel plain. However, our new scientific results suggest, that its characteristic species composition depends rather on human impact resulting from traditional coppicing with standards and silvopasturing. To study the natural development of the forest, a transect consisting of 125 single permanent monitoring plots was established within the reserve in 1986. Vegetation surveys documenting the species composition at these plots were repeated in 1993, 1998 and 2003. In 2017 the latest vegetation survey was carried out to demonstrate the species turnover after 30 years of forest management abandonment. Remarkably, alterations were noticeable in all vegetation layers (herb-, shrub-and tree-layer). Most notably was the profound alteration of the tree species composition of the canopy. While the basal area of the subcanopy and understorey layer species maple (Acer pseudoplatanus) and hornbeam (Carpinus betulus) increased, the basal area of the overstorey layer species oak (Quercus robur) and ash (Fraxinus excelsior) declined. In the shrub layer a decline in species richness and coverage was observed. Some species, e.g. oak, which is particularly significant for the community completeness and habitat structure of the Ga l i o-Ca r p i n e tum oak-hornbeam forest, were no longer detected in the shrub layer at the sampling plots. The herb layer responded by an increase of indicator species for moderate acidity and high nitrogen availability (`winners) on the one hand, and a decline of indicator species for high light availability, warmth, and high base saturation (`losers) on the other hand. Furthermore a spatial expansion of the vegetation units showing a comparatively high nitrogen supply was found. The driving factors for the observed biodiversity loss and homogenization are the discontinuation of the management practices of the formerly intensively used forest, and anthropogenic nitrogen deposition as well as a high browsing pressure by ungulates. Over the medium to long term, these factors will likely lead to a loss of the community completeness and structural diversity of the Ga l i o-Ca r p i n e tum oak-hornbeam-forest of the Echinger Lohe. © 2019 Arbeitsgemeinschaft."

While feminists have been at the forefront of these debates, they appear to be increasingly divided around the «pro-sex work» and the «sex work as a form of violence» approaches. This article argues that by conceiving these two positions as irreconcilable, and by promoting standardised international policy solutions that fail to take into account local contexts, these current feminist engagements jeopardise alternative feminist traditions in which diverse stances on sex work coexisted, and which can be usefully studied in order to overcome some of the current impasses. Taking Italy as its case study, this article shows how between the 1980s and the 1990s feminists were able to develop a «feminist alliance» capable of supporting the emancipation of women selling sex and of migrant victims of trafficking. Drawing upon the analysis of texts, we explore the strengths and weaknesses of such an alliance, and the reasons why in a context of austerity, anti-migrant sentiments, and new security approaches, it is currently at risk of disappearing, leaving the space for the new feminist polarisations. © 2019 Societa Editrice il Mulino.

Tax regulation allows evenly distributing the existing resources and thus ensuring the gradual development of a state. The task of legal regulation is to ensure the equal distribution of the tax burden and the formation of the integral perception on the part of the population of the suggested regulatory measures. The search of the equilibrium and the formation of the system of legal regulation based on the analysis of the best practices of the European states forms the relevance of the study. The novelty of the study is defined by the fact that to a greater extent, the formation of the model of sufficient tax regulation is possible if it is a targeted indicator of the social and economic development of the state. The authors of the paper except for analyzing the taxation systems of the majority of the EU states also define the way necessary for the implementation of the legislation elements in the states of the post-Soviet territory. According to the authors, it will allow to a greater extent define how the tax incomes should be distributed. The practical significance of the study is defined by the fact that at the implementation of the paper’s conclusions one may precisely define that different distribution of the funds will allow to a greater extent feasibly reforming the tax legislation in the developing countries. © 2019, by ASERS® Publishing.

Firstly, the Lagrange's energy method is employed to develop vibration equation of the RWA. The RWA model is described by twelve-dof linear differential equation with gyroscopic term. Secondly, based on the established vibration equation, disturbance model of the RWA with a discrete flexible structure is obtained. This disturbance model is simulated and discussed by taking a six-dof system as the study object. Thirdly, a frequency domain substructure method (FDSM) is used to calculate coupled disturbance response of the RWA with a continuous flexible structure, which is designed as analog of the satellite flexible installation interface. The dynamic response is validated by numerical and finite element simulations.

Region segmentation between the plant column and the soil and detection of the navigation line are two challenges to realizing the autonomous navigation of self-moving platforms. For region segmentation between the plant column and the soil, a segmentation method that based on neural networks and Otsu's method is proposed. Experiments are performed that demonstrate effective image segmentation using this approach. A noise removal technique is proposed that can effectively remove the noise from the plant column region and the noise from the soil region. A parameterized octagonal template is constructed for the navigation line detection problem after image segmentation, which is matched to the segmentation image. The matching overlap is defined as the fitness function, and the octagonal template parameter is optimized based on a genetic algorithm. Then, the octagon midline is extracted from the optimized octagonal template as the navigation line. The experiments demonstrate that the method can effectively detect the navigation line using this method, which lays a foundation for the precise navigation of self-moving platforms in complex and unstructured L.barbarum Garden environments. © 2019, Chinese Mechanical Engineering Society.

In contrast to the expected, the husband had better adherence to the treatment. On the other hand, the wife actively refused the treatment for several days, which we perceived to be a consequence of the nearly total dependence of his husband guidance. The latter, gradually improving, was very collaborative in persuading his wife to also engage in treatment.

There are eleven Nature 2000 Bird Protection Sites (SPAs) and in all of them have been registered aquatic bird species. The water surface areas were greatly reduced since the starting of the hydro-technical works 300 years ago. Nowadays, the anthropic pressure associated with the more frequent drought periods continues to threaten the water bodies, on whose existence the numerous aquatic birds depend. For the mapping and evaluation of open water surfaces in the Banat Plain, in the context of a lack of precise, consistent maps and data, the first water bodies inventory at 10-m resolution was made based on Sentinel-2 multispectral satellite images. The heterogeneous and fragmented landscape, with a great diversity of aquatic units, conducted us to develop an object-oriented approach, which allowed a multi-scale classification process. Both spectral bands and normalized differentiation water indices were used in the rule-based classification algorithm for water detection. The accuracy assessment indicated a very good overall accuracy of 96%, with a Kappa coefficient of 0.91. Also in our dataset, the small water bodies were mapped more accurately than in the other six water bodies datasets at global or European scale we compared with. The results drawn from both qualitative and quantitative assessments indicated that the water dataset developed in this study could be used as an inventory and a reference map for the permanent open water areas from the Banat Plain. It may represent the starting point for better aquatic management and elaboration of ecological strategies to support bird necessities and to counteract the increasing vulnerability and environmental threatening of waterbird species. © 2019 University of Craiova, Faculty of Social Sciences, Department of Geography.

As a typical loose slope, the municipal solid waste (MSW) landfill is easy to slide with large deformation, under high water levels or large earthquakes. A series of centrifuge model tests of landfill slide induced by rising water level and earthquake were carried out. The particle image velocimetry (PIV), laser displacement transducer (LDT) and marker tracer (MT) methods were used to measure the deformation of the landfill under different centrifugal accelerations, water levels and earthquake magnitudes. The PIV method realized the observation of continuous deformation of the landfill model, and its results were consistent with those by LDT, which had higher precision than the MT method. The deformation of the landfill was mainly vertically downward and increased linearly with the rising centrifugal acceleration. When the water level rose, the horizontal deformation of the landfill developed gradually due to the seepage, and a global slide surface formed when the critical water level was reached. The seismic deformation of the landfill was mainly vertical at a low water level, but significant horizontal deformation occurred under a high water level. The results of the tests and analyses verified the applicability of PIV in the two-dimensional deformation measurement in the centrifuge model tests of the MSW landfill, and provide an important basis for revealing the instability mechanism of landfills under extreme hydraulic and seismic conditions. © 2019 Techno-Press, Ltd. http:/www.techno-press.com/journals/sss&subpage=7"

In order to communicate correctly and avoid embarrassing situations or cultural misunderstandings between communicants of different languages, it is desirable to know phraseologisms of this or that culture. Every culture has its own, culture specipic phraseologisms that are passed on from generation to generation. In every language there is a special subgroup of phraseologisms, called phytonymic idioms or phraseophytonyms that make up an inestimable treasure for scholars. In spite of the fact that phraseology as a field of linguistics is well-developed, phraseophytonyms are not so well-studied. In modern phraseology, the popularity of phraseological units with phytonymic components increases; more and more linguists become interested in investigating this linguistic phenomenon. People have always had connection with flora and it is not surprising that this connection was materialized in phytonymic idioms that reflect cultural, ethnic peculiarities of the nation, their mentality, their customs, traditions and their world vision. Phraseophytonyms are emotionally colored and interesting to be investigated from different angles. The goal of the research is to conduct contrastive analysis of French and Georgian phytonimic phraseologisms, mark attention towards similarities and differences existing between them and make their conceptual, lexical and content based classification. In the paper we used following methods: contrastive, descriptive, analytical, linguacultural and psycholinguistic methods. © 2019 Karadeniz Technical University. All rights reserved."
"U.S.–China trade conflict and the changing multilateral trading system: Korea’s perspective","2019","Asian Economic Papers","0","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85091387644&doi=10.1162%2fasep_a_00733&partnerID=40&md5=b2b4695bba805e4ab2450fd0633ab217","One of the biggest risks to the world economy today is the U.S.–China trade tension. Korea is said to be par ticularly vulnerable to the trade conflict between the two economic giants because the United States and China are its two largest trading par tners. Under the scenario that both the United States and China mutually impose 25 percent of tariffs on all impor ts, Korea’s expor ts are projected to be reduced by USD 13.3 billion, just 2.2 percent of total expor ts in 2018. This apparent low impact is because a significant por tion of Korea’s expor ts to China are used for domestic consumption in China, not for re-expor t to third countries, including the United States. The adverse impact of the tit-for-tat tariffs between these two countries on Korea’s expor ts may not be fully realized yet, however, because of the effor ts by individual firms to avoid pre-announced tariffs. Thus, more time is needed to properly capture the influences of the U.S.–China trade tensions on the Korean economy. On the other hand, the current World Trade Organization (WTO) reform led by developed countries such as the United States, EU, and Japan can be interpreted as another version of a bilateral trade conflict between the United States and China. In fact, it targets state-owned enterprises’ (SOEs) subsidies, which are the backbone of China’s state-led economic development model. Fur thermore, WTO reform is closely related to U.S. complaints that the WTO cannot effectively control the unfair trade practices of non-market economies like China. Considering the consensus-based decision-making mechanism of the WTO, it is highly unlikely that WTO members will derive a successful agreement on the current WTO reform. Again, the WTO is in danger of dichotomy; one group led by developed members and the other group composed mostly of developing members. Each group will try to make new trade norms suited to only their own taste. © 2019 by the Asian Economic Panel and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology."

The symptomatology of edema could be considered as a pathological manifestation of connective tissue (CT). For these reasons, the aim of this study is to demonstrate the correlation between edema symptomatology and the development of pain. Twenty-two female subjects with a CE AP score between 1 and 3 were recruited to take part in a rehabilitative protocol focused on edema treatment, studying both its reduction and its relationship with pain. Methods: Patients were subjected to micro-compressive vibration treatment consisting of six sessions, twice a week, for 3 weeks. They were evaluated with a Fischer algometer and the visual analogical scale-VAS to identify variations in their pain perception. Piriformis, vastus lateralis, gastrosoleus and quadratus plantae muscles were selected for the evaluation. Results: Results demonstrated that the perception threshold improved in the piriformis muscle R=27.5%, in vastus lateralis R=47.1%, in gastrosoleus L=26.16% and in quadratus plantae R=10.6% L=38.06%. A mean percentage reduction of 17.6% was highlighted at VAS analysis. Conclusions: The relationship between the development of edema and pain symptomatology could be hypothesized and that a specific treatment on CT could reduce this condition.  © 2019 Edizioni Minerva Medica."

With the adoption of the Law of Ukraine ‘On the Constitutional Court of Ukraine’, for the sake of completeness of the trial, amicus curiae play a significant role in proving – experts and specialists who, by giving opinions on written requests of the judge-rapporteur in the case, reveal the peculiarities of socio-political discussion on complex issues arising in the course of constitutional justice. The purpose of this work is to study the amicus curiae institute, the features of its legal regulation in Ukraine and abroad, as well as to investigate the role of the institute in the constitutional process of Ukraine. The object of the research is the amicus curiae institute in the constitutional process of Ukraine. By examining the amicus curiae institute in the constitutional process of Ukraine, we can conclude that it plays an important role in the completeness of the judicial review of the case. On the one hand, the ‘friend of the court’ is a lobbyist who, thanks to his conclusions, seeks the necessary judicial decision. On the other hand, thanks to the amicus curiae institute, when considering cases that may affect an indeterminate number of persons, civil society (such as NGOs, etc.) can help ensure that the judgment is given in the light of all the circumstances relevant to the cases. However, despite the legislative consolidation of the research institute in the constitutional process of Ukraine, some procedural provisions require further refinement with the use of international experience and advanced scientific works. © 2019, by ASERS® Publishing.

"Flow-induced Vibrations of a Horizontal Elastic Band Plate Submerged in Fluid of Finite Depth","2019","Archives of Hydroengineering and Environmental Mechanics","0","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85091381938&doi=10.1515%2fheem-2019-0007&partnerID=40&md5=a40aec002151334513d36910e0f452cb","The paper deals with forced vibrations of a horizontal thin elastic plate submerged in a semi-infinite layer of fluid of constant depth. The pressure load on this plate is induced by water waves arriving at the plate. This load is accompanied by pressure resulting from the motion of the plate. The plate and fluid motions depend on boundary conditions, and, in particular, the pressure load depends on the width of the gap between the plate and the bottom. In theoretical description of the phenomenon, we deal with a coupled problem of hydrodynamics in which the plate and fluid motions are coupled through boundary conditions at the plate surfaces. The main attention is focused on transient solutions of the problem, which correspond to fluid (and plate) motion starting from rest. In formulation of this problem, a linear theory of small deflections of the plate is employed. In order to calculate the fluid pressure, a solution of Laplace's equation is constructed in a doubly connected fluid domain. With respect to the initial value problem considered, we confine our attention to a finite fluid domain. For a finite elapse of time, measured from the starting point, the solution in the finite fluid area mimics a solution within an infinite domain, inherent for wave propagation problems. Because of the complicated structure of boundary conditions of the coupled problem considered, the fluid domain is divided into sub-domains of simple geometry, and the solutions of the problem equations are constructed separately in each of these domains. Numerical experiments have been conducted to illustrate the formulation developed in this paper. © 2019 Kazimierz Szmidt et al., published by Sciendo."

In accordance with DIN EN ISO 19113 and DDGI 2007, the positional accuracy (absolute positional accuracy) and thematic accuracy (classification correctness) were quantitatively determined. For this purpose, a comparison was made with geometrical data of well-known positional accuracy such as ATKIS-DLM (Hesse) as well as with maps of biotopes and habitat types (Hesse), vegetation samplings from the Kellerwald National Park (permanent random sample inspection, own survey) and German-wide vegetation samplings from the W.I.E. database (since 1990). The map of ANOEST Germany has an absolute positional accuracy of ± 42.29 m (≈ ± 42 m). It has been classified correctly to approx. 30 %. A further approx. 35 % are ecologically similar to the existing forest ecosystem types (together 65 %). In a further approx. 15 %, the ecosystem types were correctly classified, but only appeared as non-dominant ecosystem types. Approximately 15 % occurred only as an ecologically similar ANOEST (together 30 %). 5 % of the spatial objects were mapped incorrectly. In the Kellerwald National Park (1: 25,000) about 22 % of the ANOEST were classified correctly. Misclassifications on both scales were often due to wrong assignments to the altitude level (e.g., Eb-5n-C2 instead of D1-5n-C2) and, respectively, to the humus species (e.g., Eb-5n-D1 instead of Eb-5n-D1a). The main reason for misclassifications must be seen in high thematic differentiation of the ecosystem classification according to Jenssen et al. (2013). Data on biotopes and habitattypes are more appropriate for a falsification than for a verification of ANOEST. However, the spatial information is valuable for comparisons with regard to the occurrence of ANOEST as the main or accompanying ecosystem type. The correctness of the classification can best be verified by vegetation samplings, but only at the site level. Vegetation samplings can also be used to increase the quality of the ANOEST, especially at the regional level (1: 5,000 to 1: 25,000). On this spatial scale, it is recommended, to use preferably the key for identifying forest ecosystems in Germany (Schroder et al. 2018, Bd. 3). © 2019 Arbeitsgemeinschaft."

To understand the steady and unsteady flow structures, some flow visualization experiments have been carried out to show the flow structures under wake. Ahmed model will with high air drag or low air drag according to the slant surface angle. In low drag regime, the flow above the slant surface is shown by the smoke flow. The flow begins to separate at the upper edge of slant surface and forms a shear vortex of K-H instability due to the velocity difference in wake separation regions and forms a backwards flow and recirculation bubble at the slant surface. In the high drag regime, the presence of the C-pillar vortex is shown by the smoke flow visualizations. Based on the study of K-H instability of low drag model, it is speculated that the formation of C-pillar vortex is accompanied by the existence of shear vortex. Further PIV experiments show that the structure of the C-pillar vortex is studied on a smaller scale, and the vortex of the C-pillar is found. The C-pillar is a steady flow structure, and its sub vortices are unsteady shear vortices. This sub vortex is first report in automotive aerodynamics. © 2019, Chinese Mechanical Engineering Society.

However, colour change of the coated archwires have been reported in vitro. Nonetheless, little is known to what extent this colour change occurs clinically. This second part of the multi-centre, double-blind, randomised controlled trial evaluated the colour change (ΔE∗) of three coated archwires with their controls and patient perception. Methods: 84 patients who received treatment with upper and lower fixed appliance treatment were invited. Consented patients were randomised to receive one of four treatment interventions using 0.014"" superelastic nickel-titanium archwires from (1) Orthocare (2) RMO (3) G&H, and (4) 3M Unitek® uncoated. These archwires were ligated during bonding and collected after 8th week. After removal, the digital images of the archwires were assessed for colour change using Adobe® Photoshop® software, and the CIE L∗a∗b∗ system was used to calculate the ΔE∗ values. Patient perception was measured using oral aesthetic subjective impact scale (OASIS) questionnaire. Results: For colour change and patient perception assessment, 132 archwires from 66 participants who had been treated with aesthetic archwires were collected. Two fractured archwires were excluded. Initial analysis revealed all three aesthetic archwires groups showed significant mean of ΔE∗ with the highest was found in Orthocare (23.9), and the lowest is G&H (16.8). Post hoc comparison revealed statistically significant mean of ΔE∗ in Orthocare when compared with other groups (p <0.001). There was no statistically significant difference for patient perception between archwire groups. Conclusion: Preliminary results revealed that significant ΔE∗ in Orthocare group and patients showed positive perception following clinical use. © 2019 UPM Press. All rights reserved."

In addition to hinting at the current advanced capitalist society, the zombie is also significant in uncovering certain layers about the human embodiment as well as in promoting the dominant anthropocentric discourse in Western philosophy. In its folkloric and colonial meaning in Haitian history, the zombie is enslaved by Voodoo priests for its manual power and sold as cheap slaves to land owners who, consequently, take advantagef the unconscious zombie. However, in today's perception, the zombie is a symbol for a dsytopic and apocalyptic future for human beings. The aim of this study is, thus, to investigate the zombie figure from its folkloric usage to the contemporary one as the zombie, at the present time, offers alternative modifications for the dystopic future of the humanity.

The existence of reality is questionable, because the actuality of the world of projections, which, though present in reality, often does not have meaning and is therefore created outside reality, only to exist again with meaning. In that relation, as the real world in reality, it is expressed also as an unreal world outside reality, whose imaginary reality is studied with architectural projection in a lifelike scope of reality. That way, the meaning of the projection in the process of architectural design is checked by projecting its meaning outside reality, while in the transition of an architectural design from one reality into another, the architect designer also develops his/her creative role, by reading and connecting individual (personal) and collective (universal) codes of the world of projections, which exists as two-folded and realistic in the reality scope. © 2020 Institut za Arhitekturu i Urbanizam Srbije."

It shows how three versions of Pythagoras's lineage were combined in antiquity. Firstly, Pythagoras could be seen as the son of human parents who themselves descend from Ancaeus, the mythical founder and first king of Samos who is closely connected with both Greek and Near Eastern mythology. Secondly, there is the tradition that Pythagoras was the son of a human mother and Apollo, which goes together with the important role that this deity played in the religion of Pythagoreanism from the very start. Finally, the Pythagorean doctrine of metempsychosis holds another possibility in explaining Pythagoras's genealogy that connects him directly with the shamanistic motif of the souljourney. A distinct analysis of the sources shows that the symbiosis of all three traditions was obviously the most common way of explaining Pythagoras's genealogy. © 2019 Editura Universitatii Al. I.

In this Article, we briefy review literature on punishment disparities between Latinx and white defendants (Latinx-white disparity) at the individual case level. Next, we highlight some recent studies that show how Latinx-white disparity in criminal punishment is often conditional on U.S. citizenship status. Third, we describe recent research suggesting that Latinx-white punishment disparities are conditioned by characteristics of social contexts, especially local jurisdictions' Latinx population presence and immigration characteristics. We then present findings from two current research projects: (1) a study of the relationship between Latinx-white punishment disparity in federal courts and changes in Latinx immigration in federal districts; and (2) a study of differences in the punishment of Latinx defendants in Pennsylvania state courts across counties that differ in terms of Latinx population size, immigration, and court caseload presence. A key theme of these empirical findings is that Latinx disadvantage in federal court sentencing (for non-immigration offenses) appears to concentrate among non-U.S. citizens (especially those who are undocumented) and in places that are not traditional Latinx immigration destinations. In Pennsylvania state courts, Latinx disadvantage in incarceration relative to white defendants appears to concentrate in counties with small Latinx populations, little or no Latinx population growth, or both. In fact, some of the most severe Latinx-white punishment disparities can be found in places where Latinx people are least numerous. © 2019 American Statistical Association. All rights reserved."

This Article seeks to bring the FAAAA to light, explain what is at stake in its interpretation, and argue against its application to state and local labor and employment law. Our primary aim is to spotlight - and challenge - the growing use of the FAAAA by the trucking industry as a strategy for misclassifying truck drivers. To do so, we situate industry's mobilization of FAAAA preemption to shield labor practices from state and local regulation within the broader context of industry eforts to denunionize truck ing firms. Building on a review of FAA AA doctrine, we focus particula r attention on the recent case of California Trucking Association v. Su, in which the Ninth Circuit rejected the claim that the FAAAA preempted the California state law test for determining employee status (known as the Borello test). We argue that this case stands for a broader limiting principle: that the FAAAA only applies to state and local regulation that specifically targets trucking companies, and is not intended to - and should not - apply to general labor and employment schemes that cover trucking companies equally alongside other employers. © 2019 American Statistical Association.

"Risk assessment of consuming aromatic hydrocarbons (The case study: Mesopotamichthys sharpeyi of Huralazim Wetland in Iran); [Evaluarea riscului consumului de hidrocarburi aromatice (studiu de caz: Mesopotamichthys sharpeyi din Zona umedă Huralazim, Iran]","2019","Forum Geografic","0","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85091016640&doi=10.5775%2ffg.2019.061.d&partnerID=40&md5=56d14ff63351841cd6bf393650648fb4","Background and goal: Aromatic hydrocarbons are one of the most important environmental pollutants in the environment. These compounds, even at very low concentrations, have carcinogenic and mutagenic properties and are quantitatively and qualitatively known as compounds that have entered all parts of the environment due to human activities. This research studies the concentration of aromatic hydrocarbons in the predominantly fish (Mesopotamichthys sharpeyi) in Huralazim wetland and calculates the risk of consuming this fish by a human. Materials and Methods: In the spring of 2018, 210 fish were collected from 4 reservoirs (7 stations). The analysis of 16 hydrocarbon compounds was carried out using the GC-FID (Shimadzn-14A) equipped with a capillary column (RTX-5). Results: The highest concentration of oil-based hydrocarbons was in fish of station 7 (43.93 ± 2.70 mg/kg) and its lowest concentration was at station 1 (9.52 ± 3.06 mg/kg). The highest carcinogenesis incidence rate was 1.13 at station 7 and the highest mutation rate was 23.49 at station 5. The gradual carcinogenesis rate of Benz [a] pyrene was 0.00003 to 0.0029 and n in general, through Huralazim Wetland it was 0.0027. The gradual mutation risk assessment for Benz [a] pyrene was estimated as 0.055 (which ranges from 0.034 to 0.061). Conclusion: According to the standard of mutant and carcinogenic compounds [5], it can be said that the daily consumption of fish in this wetland increases the risk of cancer and mutagen in the consumer population. Measures have to be taken to reduce the consumption of caught fish which are exposed to pollution in Huralazim Wetland, in order to minimize the risk of gradual cancer or mutagen, especially in the natives of that area. © 2019 University of Craiova, Faculty of Social Sciences, Department of Geography.

Different approaches to the application of spatial modeling in architectural design are possible, taking into consideration on the one hand the theoretical background and knowledge of geometry, and on the other, advanced computational techniques. The generative principles of complex dynamic spatial formation allow parallels between the differentiated representations and directions of approach to spatial organization. The integration of conceptual, theoretical and practical methods into complex dynamic geometric models in the preliminary phase of design could support the development of cognitive capabilities, internal representations and understanding of complex dynamic formative processes. The development of nonlinear, dynamic, complex spatial imaginative thinking corresponds with trends in contemporary computational design.

In equating Mexicans with criminality, these networked forces and actors regarded and treated these residents as exceptions - as morally requiring and legally meriting authoritarian rather than accountability practices. These practices did not require invocation of the president's emergency power and did not occur outside the rule of law. Instead, authoritarian practices targeting exceptions like the residents of 1950s East LA reflect routine choices made from (and always available) within the rule of law, made across eras and regions and colonial outposts of the United States, representing the paradigmatic instances of authoritarianism in a constitutional democracy. Contrary to time-honored wisdom, we cannot eliminate the availability of clashing choices within law. Authoritarian practices - every bit as much as accountability practices at the other end of the same continuum - are and shall remain legally legitimate action. Contrary to pacifying speeches, lectures, and sermons, we cannot eliminate fierce struggles over rival visions of the national community. Every discretionary choice each of us makes within networks of systems, institutions, and individuals expresses a view about how we wish to live in our neighborhoods, this country, and across the globe, including which people we feel justified in targeting as exceptions, often for racist reasons. Yet we can and should challenge and aim to obliterate widely hailed and deeply delusional orthodoxies about the criminal justice system, about networked authoritarian practices, about the rule of law itself. Those who insist we must remain loyal to these lies offer a horrific but familiar endorsement of life in 1950s East LA and of the current status quo. Living as we still do in the United States routinely degrades, devastates, and destroys certain groups of people. Living as we still do regularly benefits certain others, especially those within the networked systems targeting exceptions and the bipartisan mainstream enablers who rarely, if ever, put themselves on the line against authoritarian practices. ""Enough,"" as many people I knew growing up in 1950s East LA would say. ""Enough.""

It raises the issue of the role Moroccan women played in these movements. In attempting to address this issue, the article relies essentially on bibliographical information and data derived from studies and writings that dealt with the feminist struggle in Morocco as a whole. It suffers from the lack of openness to a sociological approach or a political viewpoint in Arab and foreign scientific productions concerned with the struggles of women in Arab or Maghreb countries. In parallel, the study uses ethnographic research discerningly, since accurate and sufficient information available on the local protest movements has not received the necessary follow-up and definition. The article first monitors the shift in the dynamics of women's protests and focuses on the persistent manifestations within them; it also considers the motives that contribute to the growth of this dynamic while stressing the extent of women's participation in the February 20 Movement and in rural areas. It then identifies the results and extensions of this participation in relation to the requirements of empowerment. Finally, it discusses the problem of development and democracy that prevent women from achieving the desired change in the short term. © 2019 by the Centre for Arab Unity Studies.

Materials & Methods: A pilot instrument based on the ussq was designed and structured, using the Delphi method. It was applied to 72 patients with an indwelling ureteral stent after semirigid ureteroscopy. The instrument was validated through the Cronbach’s alpha coefficient and Pearson’s correlation coefficient. Results: The ureteral stent discomfort test (usdt) utilizes a Likert scale model, with 6 domains: 1-urinary symptoms, 2-pain, 3-daily life, 4-sexual life, 5-medical care/use of analgesics, and 6-quality of life, with 6, 2, 1, 1, 2, and 1 items, respectively. The more severe the symptoms, the higher the score, with a maximum score of 61 points. Validation studies made the questionnaire internally consistent (Cronbach 0.820) with good reliability (Pearson 0.850). The correlation of urinary symptoms (r = 0.929, p = 0.00), pain (r = 0.880, p = 0.00), daily life (r = 0.625, p = 0.00), and quality of life (r = 0.768, p = 0.00) of both questionnaires was statistically significant. Application time for the usdt (m = 1.8min sd = 0.76) was shorter than for the ussq (m = 8.3min sd = 0.76). Limitations: The small sample size was a restriction. More patients are required to demonstrate the usdt’s effectiveness. Value: The questionnaire is an easy-to-use tool for the simple evaluation of ureteral stent discomfort.

The aim of this study is to investigate the photophysical phenomena of this treatment combination. Methods: Polidocanol (Aethoxysklerol® 0.5%) was poured in the silica cell in liquid form and analyzed with a spectrometer. The measurement was repeated with the drug emulsified, turning it into a white microfoam, 3, 9 and 30 minutes after emulsification. To verify that the microfoam absorbs radiation, a temperature measurement was performed. The liquid polidocanol, poured into a quartz capillary, was irradiated with a laser and the temperature of the liquid was measured with a thermocouple during irradiation. Afterwards the measure was repeated with the microfoam. Results: The liquid polidocanol is nearly transparent to radiation, while the microfoam becomes highly absorptive at 900-1100 nm within 3 minutes from emulsification. When irradiated the liquid polidocanol shows a temperature increase of 4 °C, while the microfoam increased by 51 °C. CO Nclusions: These results explain the success in the treatment of telangiectases using the laser irradiation of polidocanol microfoam. The irradiation heats the microfoam, leading to thermo-shrinkage effects of the vessels. The laser wavelengths most suitable to induce these effects have been identified. © 2019 Edizioni Minerva Medica. All rights reserved."

Currently, two different mixing methods are used during whole blood collection: manual mixing and mixing using an automated blood collection mixer. However, the cost between manual and automated blood collection mixer differed largely and pose a dilemma for a blood transfusion service. The objective of this study was to evaluate PCs quality using either manual mixing or automated procedure. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study conducted at the Advanced Medical and Dental Institute, Universiti Sains Malaysia. Thirty eligible participants aged 20 to 45 were included in this study, and a unit of 450 mL whole blood was collected from each participant. Fifteen units of whole blood were mixed by an automated blood collection mixer and the other 15 units were mixed using the manual mixing. All PCs were produced from platelet-rich plasma and stored at 20-24°C for 5 days. Quality parameters such as platelet count, leucocyte count, and pH were measured for each PCs on day 1 and day 5. Results: Platelet count on day 1 was significantly higher than on day 5 (p = 0.01) for both mixing methods. There was no statistically significant difference in any of the PCs quality parameters between the two types of mixing methods at either day 1 or day 5 of storage (p > 0.05). Conclusion: Comparable PCs quality is achieved from both manual mixing and automated procedures. © 2019 UPM Press. All rights reserved."

A fully randomised design method was used to evaluate the effect of apical bud pruning on the growth of axillary buds in spinach plants. The samples were assigned to the following groups: the first group (J0) served as the control for the experiment while the experimental groups had varying lengths of pruned apical buds (J1- 3cm, J2- 6cm, J3-9cm and J4- 12 cm). Each test was replicated four times to reduce variability in the experimental results. The findings of the study showed that the pruning of apical buds led to an increase in the formation of leaves and the growth of axillary buds. Although the numbers of axillary buds in spinach plants from each treatment group were significantly different, the most notable disparity was observed in J1 plants with an average axillary bud growth of 66. The use of this experiment-based learning approach enhanced the students' ability to use their cognitive, social, psychomotor, and problem-solving skills in the acquisition of knowledge, as well as the analysis and interpretation of data. Based on these findings, it can be concluded that the practical experiment on the effect of apical bud pruning on axillary bud growth should be implemented in the learning process for horticulture courses in IKIP Saraswati. Despite the benefits of the experimental based learning approach, there are certain limitations to its successful implementation in the education system. Some of these include the integration of the experimental learning method to the existing curriculum for horticulture courses, the need to develop new assessment methods in order to evaluate the efficacy of this method, and the insufficient support of teachers and administrators at different tiers of government. This paper also provides recommendations on effective ways to address these challenges and maximize the benefits provided by the experimental based learning methods in the education system. © Advanced Scientific Research.

The relevance of the study is determined by the fact that the possibility of preventing a terrorist act should be in the interdepartmental jurisdiction of law enforcement agencies not only as a task of emergency response, but also as a task of direct monitoring. The novelty of the study is determined by the fact that the authors consider the aspect of the formation of countermeasures against a terrorist act on the basis of liquidating the foundation of its social response. The very process of preventing a terrorist act predominantly affects only measures to destroy terrorists and reduce the number of potential victims. The paper demonstrates that in addition to this postulate, it is worth considering the need for an additional reduction in social resonance, which acts as an incentive. Formation of counteraction by law enforcement agencies allows to reduce the significance of the terrorist impact on society. The practical significance of the study is determined by the fact that each of the participants in countering the terrorist act is also capable of operative activities, which can also additionally level the structure for implementing the provisions of anti-terrorism legislation. © 2019, ASERS Publishing House.

This simple approach is consistent with several other international steel design codes and design guidelines. These effective length factors make no allowance for the stiffness of the adjacent span, but in reality warping at the supports allows interaction buckling between the cantilever and beam segments. In the research presented in this paper the backspan-to-overhang-segment ratio was investigated with the view of refining the calculations for determining the critical buckling moment of overhang beams. The scope was limited to beams with lateral and torsional restraints at the supports, and to shear centre and top flange loading applied at the free overhang end. Physical experiments and finite solid element analyses were used to determine the relationship between the critical moments and the beam buckling parameters. A simplified design calculation procedure was formulated, which includes a buckling parameter to include warping at the supports and allows interaction buckling between the beam segments. The buckling parameter is dependent on the size of the beam, the length of the overhanging segment and the ratio of backspan-to-overhang length. © 2019 South African Institute of Civil Engineers.

In particular, it looks at three aspects of Singapore's pre-colonial existence-modes of economic production, patterns of consumption of international products, and the articulation of high culture vis-à-vis external entities. By examining available archaeological, epigraphic, art historical and cartographic data from the fourteenth through the nineteenth centuries, this article postulates how distinct consumption patterns may have developed among different riverside populations living north of the Singapore River.

This study conducted a series of numerical experiments using Matlab. By conducting FFT analysis on designated wave trains, the FFT results revealed that an extra phase shift of i(2π/N), with N representing the number of data points for an i-th wave component, was implicitly added to the analyzed phases during the analysis. When extra phase shifts were subtracted from the analyzed phases of each component, signals could be completely reconstructed in the time domain with an acceptable difference. This study tested component and non-component waveforms, linear and nonlinear waveforms, multiple-component waveforms (one-, two-, three-, and four-waves), and several laboratory irregular wave records. The results confirmed a strong relation between the extra phase shift and the time shift of the wave profile. Accordingly, Fourier series used for wave profile recovery in the time domain should start from time 0 to avoid phase shifts. Although this study did not employ all possible FFT packages for experiments, except for Matlab and some alternatives, the time series definitions in the frequency and time domains were suggested to be identical; thus, water wave analyses in both domains can be closely connected. From the experiments, more understanding about characteristics of various waveforms were achieved, and more extensive researches and applications can be conducted using the procedure described herein. © 2019 National Taiwan Ocean University.

However, Amin Sweeney's efforts to historicise some aspects of Abdullah's life and writings have established that Abdullah was much more than a sharp social critic of Malays and their rulers. He is better understood as a subtle critic and even a manipulator of his European interlocutors who craftily used his occidental contacts and connections alongside his local knowledge to preserve his role as a cultural intermediary in a burgeoning port settlement. Sweeney's efforts bring into focus a multifaceted imperial experience where notions like 'interactions' and 'connections' become viable descriptive categories in making sense of the intersections of Abdullah and empire, thereby strongly resonating with networked conceptions of imperial space propounded by 'new' imperial history. Taken alongside the recent literary and theoretical efforts of Jan van der Putten and Sanjay Krishnan respectively on Abdullah, and the carefully circumscribed historical efforts of Ian Proudfoot, the recent historiography of Abdullah offers fresh interpretive possibilities of early colonial Singapore. Leveraging such developments to engage with Mary Turnbull's scripting of a gruesome episode in 1823 indicates that Turnbull's historiographical dominance of Singapore's early colonial history can be transcended to better represent British coloniality, warts and all. © 2020 The National University of Singapore."

The study has found that the mechanism of legal tax regulation is primarily related to the legal regulation of tax debt to ensure its proper execution. Full and timely payment of taxes or fees is meant by proper execution. The implementation of tax debt is defined both in the Basic Law of the state, where the emphasis is placed on the imperative requirement for timely payment of taxes and fees in full, and in the Tax code of Ukraine, which establishes the definition of tax debt as the taxpayer's obligation to calculate, declare and / or pay the amount of tax and fee in the manner and terms determined by the Tax code of Ukraine, customs laws. The analysis of the legislation and the scientific literature has revealed that the most important issue on taxes and fees payment regulation is the establishment of the moment from which the obligation for tax payment arises. Having rights and obligations for a person is another important factor if he becomes a participant in tax relations. The mechanism of legal tax regulation is a set of elements, which are defined in the Tax Code of Ukraine and in accordance with it are divided into basic, additional and optional. The mechanism of legal tax regulation is possible only as a set of basic and additional elements. The absence of at least one of the elements will not allow to legislate a separate tax or levy. The study provides a comprehensive analysis of each element of the tax mechanism. © 2019, ASERS Publishing House. All rights reserved."

Although Jurij Lotman's theory concerning literary space, which is arguably one of most illuminating discussions in the field, was developed mainly with reference to fiction, drama and the theatre are no less important in this respect, including, of course, Shakespeare's plays. In the past few years, Macbeth in particular has come under scrutiny in this context, albeit space in this tragedy has mostly been analysed in an unsystematic and partial way (with special emphasis on the castles). The present essay, while drawing on previous research, purports to complement it by systematizing the spaces and their forms of semanticization in Macbeth, extending the spaces under discussion so that imagery and 'transcendental' spaces (heaven and hell) are also included; above all, it highlights the remarkably ambiguous, 'equivocal' and unstable use of spaces in this play as indicative of a profoundly ambivalent worldview. © 2019 Gunter Narr Verlag.

A certain percentage of CeO2 added into TiO2 after calcination can improve the effect of degradation. The composite (TiO2-CeO2) was used to modify the stainless-steel material (SS316). The results showed that the porosity of the plate after optimal parameterization was 18%, indicating that the electrode can effectively increase the contact area of the composite TiO2-CeO2, increasing its response current 2.11 times in linear sweep voltammetry. The conductivity of the modified electrode was 1.88 times greater than that of SS316 in a four-point probe experiment. In the Tafel corrosion experiment, the plate after optimal parameterization had a corrosion potential ranging from -299 mV to -160 mV and a corrosion current ranging from 524 nA to 107 nA, which greatly improved the anticorrosion effect of the original SS316 substrate. In the photoelectric-Fenton experiment, the degradation rate of the composite electrode was 50.83% in 30 min, which was 1.26 times higher that of the SS316 substrate. The results showed that the 3 TiO2: 1 CeO2:/SS316 electrode has good stability and a good degradation effect in the Photoelectric Fenton process. © 2019, Chinese Mechanical Engineering Society.

However, in the age of the Anthropocene where humans take active role in shaping the Earth's geology and ecology, there are no such distinctions between the two, but a complex relationship between nature and culture, humans and their societal, governmental and economic policies over the fate of the world. In such a world, uninformed and often imprudent politicians of the world, and their failure in taking the necessary measures results in disasters that affect the poor, disadvantaged, and marginal communities more than the rich, advantaged, and affluent communities.

To overcome the difficulties, we construct the GLAKJ which combines the two output motions into a single input mechanism. This ergonomic design can reduce the discomfort causing by the inconsistency between the knee joint and the exoskeleton. On the other hand, we use a vision-based system to measure the knee joint data for parameters identification. The vision-based method requires only a low-cost device to customize the GLAKJ for patients. In the experiments, the measured knee joint data of three subjects are validated and implemented on the proposed exoskeleton, and the results have similar motion like the human knee joint. © 2019, Chinese Mechanical Engineering Society.

Later, Herbert Marcuse's Soviet Marxism (1958) was translated into Arabic in Beirut in 1965, and with the rise of student protests in France, Germany, and the United States, much attention was given to Marcuse; almost all his writings were translated into Arabic between 1969 and 1973. This article explores the nature of individual ""receptions"" of the critical theory of the Frankfurt School at Egyptian universities. To this end, it briefly introduces the early generation of the Frankfurt School, as well as the reasons of interest in its fate in Egyptian universities. Though master's theses and doctoral dissertations do not represent a university's orientation to critical theory, and at best represent the perspective of their individual authors, this article shows that key individual theses and dissertations testify to an early rejection of the Frankfurt School and to the late adoption of it as a critical paradigm of the transformations in Egyptian society. © 2019 by the Centre for Arab Unity Studies.

This study found that current institutional arrangements between electricity suppliers (Eskom), water service providers and water service authorities are insufficient. Therefore, a Risk Analysis and Mitigation Framework of Integrated Water and Electricity Systems, or RAMFIWES, was developed. Risks associated with water supply interruptions due to electricity disruption events were analysed. Risk categories that were addressed are short-term disruptions of less than one day, medium-term disruptions of up to a week and long-term electricity disruptions up to a month or even longer. The direct economic benefits of ensuring uninterrupted water supply in the event of electricity disruption events were analysed through cost versus benefit analyses. It was found that the direct benefit/cost ratio of supplying water during electricity disruption events is 5.6 for wet-industries and an exceptional 117 for other economic sectors in Tshwane.

Near-surface residual stresses of the ground surfaces are found to be all compressive for all chip loading conditions with the transverse residual stress more affected by the chip load. Through Raman spectra of the ground surface, it is shown that the Si-I phase tends to transform to Si-III/Si-XII at a lager chip load, and to amorphous phase at a smaller chip load. SEM surface topography reveals that the degree of plowing in surface formation increases with chip load, and that surface residual stress and phase transformation can be correlated to the extent of plowing phenomenon on the silicon surface during the material removal process. It is concluded that grinding condition with higher chip load leads to the formation of Si-III/Si-XII phases as well as a higher transverse surface residual stress while a smaller chip load is favorable in the formation of an amorphous phase and low residual stress. © 2019, Chinese Mechanical Engineering Society.

Because of different shapes of aggregate and thin ITZs, a huge number of elements are often used in the finite element (FEM) analysis. In order to ensure the accuracy of the numerical solutions near the interfaces, we need to use higher-order elements. The widely used FEM softwares such as ANSYS and ABAQUS all provide the option of quadratic elements. However, they have much higher computational complexity than the linear elements. The corresponding coefficient matrix of the system of equations is a highly ill-conditioned matrix due to the large difference between three phase materials, and the convergence rate of the commonly used solving methods will deteriorate. In this paper, two types of simple and efficient preconditioners are proposed for the system of equations of the concrete aggregate models on unstructured triangle meshes by using the resulting hierarchical structure and the properties of the diagonal block matrices. The main computational cost of these preconditioners is how to efficiently solve the system of equations by using linear elements, and thus we can provide some efficient and robust solvers by calling the existing geometric-based algebraic multigrid (GAMG) methods. Since the hierarchical basis functions are used, we need not present those algebraic criterions to judge the relationships between the unknown variables and the geometric node types, and the grid transfer operators are also trivial. This makes it easy to find the linear element matrix derived directly from the fine level matrix, and thus the overall efficiency is greatly improved. The numerical results have verified the efficiency of the resulting preconditioned conjugate gradient (PCG) methods which are applied to the solution of several typical aggregate models. © 2019 Global Science Press."

Due to its revolutionary nature, Romanticism offers groundbreaking changes in the understanding of universe, nature and man. In literature, these changes can be seen both in the form and content of the works. In addition, inspired by these revolutionary ideas, British romantics such as William Blake redefined the new concept of the poet. To him, the Romantic poet is an inspired and gifted individual who has the ability to see in nature what others cannot. Thus, the poet has the responsibility of informing his fellow man with his prospects. For Blake, the Romantic poet is a redeemer in this sense. On the other hand, it is possible trace Blake's ideas on the poet, in the works of 17th century Ottoman poet Nef'î. This study attempts to investigate the concept of redeemer poet in both Blake's and Nef'î's works in a comparative manner. © 2019 Karadeniz Technical University. All rights reserved."
"Coincidence between two binary recurrent sequences of polynomials arising from diophantine triples","2019","Tokyo Journal of Mathematics","0","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85091090520&doi=10.3836%2ftjm%2f1502179292&partnerID=40&md5=def85fda916668e72e58cf4829afab5c","A set of positive integers is called a Diophantine tuple if the product of any two elements in the set increased by 1 is a perfect square. A conjecture in this field asserts that any Diophantine triple can be uniquely extended to a Diophantine quadruple in some sense. This problem is reduced to study the coincidence between certain two binary recurrent sequences of integers. As an analogy of this, we consider a similar coincidence on the polynomial ring in one variable over the integers, and determine it completely. Our result is regarded as a generalization of a result in the paper “Complete solution of the polynomial version of a problem of Diophantus” by A. Dujella, C.

We present and describe several methods applicable for the analysis of low-frequency sea level oscillations in the Mediterranean Sea: wavelet analysis, spectral analysis, moving-periodogram analysis, and rotary spectral analysis. These methods were applied for characterisation of subinertial sea level oscillations with periods greater of the period of inertial oscillation (18 hours in the Northern Adriatic Sea) on measured sea surface elevations and current velocities in the Mediterranean Sea. Preliminary analysis was performed on observations of a storm event in the Adriatic Sea at the end of January and the beginning of February 2014, revealing a peak in the frequency spectrum in the frequency band between 0.3-0.4 day-1. Further analysis was done on long-term tide gauge measurements available for 62 stations in the Mediterranean basin. The application of the selected methods provided a preliminary set of seasonal occurrences and durations of subinertial oscillation. This sets the ground for further investigation into the propagation of low-frequency sea level oscillations throughout the Mediterranean basin and for characterisation of the mechanisms triggering the process, including with regard to climate change. © Bertoncelj V. et al."

This discovery reveals a previously unknown aspect of residential decoration in the early decades of seventeenth-century Transylvania, the motif being at the same time the only example of mural decoration known to be a literal copy after designs in the Pugillus facetiarum and one of the very few such in the non-manuscript art of pre-modern Europe. That this anthology exerted a considerable influence in Transylvania is suggested by the fact that a second motif from the volume inspired the murals of a contemporary house in the same city, on the former Fleischergasse 17 (1628). The identification of these motifs in the Sibiu murals and of their graphic source is important evidence both for their diffusion, and for its demonstration of the familiarity of the Siebenbürgischer Sachsen (Transylvanian Saxon) urban elite with the latest Western European art and culture, including the friendship books—Stammbuch or alba amicorum. © 2019, Center Transylvanian Studies.

Therefore, such fragments are often unpredictable, since the question of the admissibility of conducting research on humans has always been part of the general social and philosophical system that determines the development of society. The novelty of the study is that for the first time in the legal and philosophical literature the question of the conformity of what is called biological and medical ethics is raised in accordance with the national culture and national identity. The authors of the article clearly identify the inseparability of the connection between the cultural and statistical approach to the expediency of regulating biomedical experiments and their legal regulation. The structure of international legislation and its regional adaptation in Russian legislation are revealed. The practical significance of the study is determined by the possibility of forming a stable position regarding the possibilities of expanding the subject of legal regulation of biomedical ethics.

Two approaches for reducing the number of nodes are suggested. First we show that different permutations of the basis vectors have a big effect on the running time of standard enumeration, and give a class of permutations that give relatively few nodes in the search tree. This leads to an algorithm called hybrid enumeration that has a better running time than standard enumeration when the lattice is large. Next we show that it is possible to estimate the signs of the coefficients yielding a shortest vector, and that a pruning strategy can be based on this fact. Sign-based pruning gives fewer nodes in the search tree, and never missed the shortest vector in the experiments we did. © 2019 Scientific Association for Infocommunications. All rights reserved."

In mice model of atherosclerosis, murine norovirus-4 has been shown to accelerate atherogenesis. In cells, lipid biometabolism is regulated by peroxisome proliferator activated receptor γ (PPARγ). Since PPARγ is predominantly expressed in macrophages and mice macrophages are MNV-1 proliferation-permissive host, we hypothesised that PPARγ ligands may regulate atherogenesis. Methods: MNV-1 was generated via RNA-based recovery system and used to infect the RAW 264.7 cells, then subjected to oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL)-loaded and treated with ciglitazone or 15-deoxy-Delta(12,14)-PGJ(2)(15d-PGJ2). Foam cell formation was evaluated and the MNV-1 infection in all treatments was confirmed using virus titration (50% tissue culture infective dose; TCID50) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Results: Increment of lipid droplets was observed in all oxLDL treatment involving MNV-1 infection, ciglitazone or 15d-PGJ2 in the cytosol of RAW 264.7 cells over time compared to non-oxLDL treated cells. From the cholesterol ester (CE) content analysis amongst the oxLDL-loaded cells however, we found MNV-1 did not elicit increment of CE content. Treatment with 15d-PGJ2 resulted in increase of the CE content in oxLDL-treated cells. Interestingly, MNV-1 and ciglitazone had synergistic effect in reducing the CE content in oxLDL-treated cells. Conclusion: oxLDL stimulates foam cells formation in RAW 264.7 cells. However, MNV-1 infection did not contribute to RAW 264.7 cells derived-foam cells formation. On the other hand, 15d-PGJ2 promotes foam cells formation whilst ciglitazone inhibits the formation of foam cells derived from MNV-1-infected macrophages. © 2019 UPM Press. All rights reserved."

Schools are important settings to promote healthy eating habits. The aim of this study was to assess the extent of compliance with 2010 and 2014 Mexican school food guidelines in six public primary schools in Mexico City. The instruments for this study included semi-structured interviews (n=17) with principals, food vendors and members of the School Vending Committee, focus groups (n=10) with teachers and with parents, observation of six schools' environments, questionnaires applied to 325 schoolchildren from 4th, 5th and 6th grades and their parents, and a food analysis of items sold at school vending. Guidelines' compliance was assessed using all instruments accordingly. It was low in every dimension: 1) Acknowledgment of school food guidelines: None of the participants were familiar with the 2014 guidelines. 2) Healthy environment enhancement: Children lacked free access to safe drinking water. Children had up to five opportunities to eat during school day besides breakfast at home. Most children (67.7%) ate three to four times. 3) Operability of food and beverages sale and consumption: The only training provided to stakeholders was an annual session on hygiene to school food vendors. The majority of food and beverages offered at school vending exceeded energy, sodium, fat and added sugar content as established. Children sold energy-dense foods for school fundraising. Lack of dissemination and acknowledgment of the guidelines, defined roles and policy procedures, as well as training and capacity building for stakeholders impeded school food guidelines'proper implementation.

However, conventional series elastic actuators face a performance limitation due to the compromise on the elastic element stiffness selection. This paper presents a novel two different stiffness series elastic actuator (DSSEA) and an optimal controller for it to address the performance limitation. In particular, two both stiffness and length are different springs were chosen as the elastic element of the DSSEA. The low stiffness spring single used to deal with the low force operation and the two spring combined used to handle the large force operation. To address the challenge of the smooth transition between those two operation cases, a segmental model-based feedback controller with feedforward compensation is proposed, and a smooth switching controller is designed to handle the transition interval. The experimental results from DSSEA prototype demonstrate that the proposed controller can achieve excellent force tracking performance at both low, high, and wide-bound force range operation. © 2019, Chinese Mechanical Engineering Society.

The VWF profiles among the Malay population has not yet been established. The current study aims to determine the VWF profiles of the different ABO blood types among Malays and to evaluate their association with demographic characteristics and smoking habits. Methods: One hundred and forty Malay donors were involved. Factor VIII (FVIII:C), VWF antigen (VWF:Ag), and ristocetin cofactor (VWF:RiCof) levels and collagen binding activity (VWF:CBA) were measured by coagulometric clot detection, latex agglutination, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results: The majority of donors (59.3%) were 30-49 years old, male (81.43%), non-smokers (74.3%), and overweight (71.4%). The Malay VWF:Ag were slightly higher than those of Caucasians, Indians, Thais, and Chinese, but the average ratios of VWF activity (i.e., VWF:RiCof level and VWF:CBA) to VWF:Ag were slightly lower than those of the other populations. The highest level of VWF:Ag was found among those with the B blood group, followed by types A and O. Conclusion: Malays with type O blood had lower values of the components of the VWF profile compared to subjects with non-O blood. The higher levels of these elements and lower VWF activity to VWF:Ag ratio in Malays compared to other populations suggest that ethnicity impacts the plasma VWF levels and their interaction with collagen and platelets. © 2019 UPM Press.

The proposed restrictor consists of a compensation block and two disc springs and offers the advantages of self-sensing compensation and easy installation. First, interrelated theories are presented on the self-compensating restrictor installed within the hydrostatic bearing. Second, equations are derived that govern the dimensionless relationship between the stiffness, gap, and resistance of the bearing land and the eternally applied load on the bearing. Influences of the design parameters on bearing performance and the feasibility of the design are then assessed both analytically and experimentally. The results of the theoretical analysis are then compared with the experimental results. These demonstrate that the proposed restrictor exhibits superior performance in terms of stiffness and load-carrying capacity. Furthermore, it has the advantage of simplicity in its manufacture and assembly. © 2019, Chinese Mechanical Engineering Society. All right reserved."
"Were Mexican American communities safer than others? Some surprising findings from San Antonio, 1960-1980","2019","UCLA Law Review","0","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85090165996&partnerID=40&md5=78e013dc17b46538135d09ddb748f4c5","Contradicting widespread belief, scholarly research has confirmed that Mexican American (Latino/a/x) communities have lower levels of homicide than expected, given their high levels of economic disadvantage, residential instability, and rapid population change. But scholars are just beginning to explore the various social dynamics underlying this relationship at the community level for Mexican Americans throughout modern history. This Article explores those social and economic dynamics and fills an important research void in the literature on race, ethnicity, and crime. Examining the past conditions that gave rise to Mexican American homicides in an era when this population was ignored or avoided in the research literature permits keener understanding of the factors that shape views of crime and how ethnicity influences them. Since the 1950s, have community-level studies consistently found that economic disadvantage and immigration contribute to Mexican American violence? Does that include periods when economic disadvantage, relative to Anglo Americans (non-Latino whites), was high and immigration was low in cities where both were the largest racial and ethnic groups? In this Article, the enduring race and crime debate centers on the Latino/a/x origin and violent crime relationship vis-à-vis Mexican Americans. This debate - whether Mexican Americans are prone to committing more crime - is revisited using census tract data (1960, 1970, and 1980). The Article starts with the premise that San Antonio resembles other cities in the southwestern United States in terms of Mexican border proximity, population growth, economic change, homicide decline, and relatively stable immigration levels.1In sum, results from this community, different time points linking the past to the present, and discussions connecting national level trends to community and homicides are addressed. The typical community-level finding now is that more immigration means less homicide, and that economic disadvantage contributes to violent crime. But that outcome is rarely examined in the context of the past, across different time points, and in a by-the-border city with a large native-born Mexican American population. We found that economic disadvantage persists in contributing to violent crime in a historically Mexican American city over time, perhaps even more so than in other periods, especially when the gap between Mexicans and Anglos is widest, and in an era when immigration is stagnant. © 2019 American Statistical Association.

They were not Chinese-speaking nationality/ethnicity in history. However, with their ethnic boundaries dissolved as the result of assimilation, Hui is more regarded as a “Chinesized Muslim minority” compared with other Muslim minorities in China. Linguistically, Hui is governmentally recognized as a “solely Chinese-speaking ethnic minority in China” with some distinct linguistic phenomena discovered by academia (e.g. few Arabic/Persian code-mixing in Chinese dialogue, special language taboos, a series of specific business jargons, etc.). Ethnic boundaries tend to coincide with linguistic ones. To explore the ethnical identity of Hui and its relationship to language boundaries, this paper presents an empirical study of narratives collected from Hui people living in Huhhot, Inner Mongolia. The finding suggests a pragmatic difference of Hui people with a wide range of corresponding Hui identities. Language attrition is proportional to identity attrition, and different proportion of “Chineseness” and “Muslimness” among Hui people contribute to the ingroup language discrepancy and identity crisis. The result of this paper could partly reflect the fading of old, boundary-based ethnicity and the rise of new, imagination-based state-defined ethnicity in China. © 2019 Karadeniz Technical University.

The purpose of this qualitative study was threefold; first, to explore the relationship between PTSD and lower respiratory symptoms (LRS); second, to identify factors influencing self-management and treatment of both disorders; and third, to determine the impact of these comorbidities on quality of life. The goal was to identify strategies to improve coordination of medical and mental health management in order to reduce the symptomatic burden of these two health conditions. In-depth, semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted among 34 World Trade Center Health Registry (WTCHR) rescue/recovery workers and community members with both active LRS (self-reported history of cough, wheeze or shortness of breath) and report of PTSD diagnosis on their 2015–2016 survey. Thematic analysis identified 14 themes grouped into six main categories: relationship between LRS and PTSD, impact of symptoms on quality of life, medical management, symptom management strategies, current health status, and exposure history and symptoms. Participants spoke of a wide range of both symptom triggers and management strategies, including self-management and some maladaptive management behaviors such as smoking and alcohol consumption. Participants also spoke of feeling like there were gaps in their healthcare, particularly for mental health. In addition, many spoke to a lack of coordinated care between physical and mental health. The majority of participants did not feel that there was a link between their PTSD and LRS, and among them a large portion also reported a lack of control over their symptoms. Proactive and collaborative planning steps at multiple levels (healthcare, public health, disaster management) are needed to prevent adverse impacts of disasters. Because of the increasing trend in disasters (both natural and man-made), with potentially wide-ranging exposures, it is important to plan for the complex treatment of PTSD and other co-morbidities. © 2019"

Knowledge constraints are the cause of the low utilization of antenatal services. Through the Antenatal Education (AE) class, it is hoped that mother’s knowledge and attitudes can be improved. AE class is not effective because of low participation of mothers. The purpose of study was to analyze the relationship need factors for ANC and their participation in AE class. It was a quantitative survey with cross-sectional design. Sample was 140 pregnant women that selected using purposive sampling based on characteristics of PHC. The study showed no relationship between history of illness and pregnancy, perception of pregnancy, level of pregnancy complaints and perceived level of danger pregnancy for maternal participation in AE class. In a composite analysis it is proven that the need factors of pregnant women for antenatal care is related to the mothers participation in AE class. Mother’s perception of pregnancy is a key factor to increasing the taste and value of her needs. Increasing the sense of need can be done through improvement of women’s access and roles in the family and community about maternal health services. Continuous efforts need to be made as encouragement as well as support for AE class through structured and integrated socialization to every pregnant woman. © 2019, Indian Journal of Public Health Research and Development.

The release of inflammatory mediators like prostaglandins E2 and Interleukin-1β act as potent stimulators of bone resorption. Application of heavy force results in pain and to relieve the same non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are prescribed. These NSAIDs negate the inflammatory reactions by interfering with the synthesis of prostaglandins(PG), thus inhibiting orthodontic tooth movement. The purpose of this mini-review of literature was to highlight the effects of the two commonly used drugs, namely acetaminophen and ibuprofen on their pain relieving ability and effect on OTM. It was concluded that acetaminophen was a potent analgesic that could be used to relieve the discomfort associated with orthodontic treatment as its effect was at the central nervous system level and not at the cell membrane level as also since it inhibited the PG synthesis very slightlyits inhibitory effect on OTM was not a matter of concern. On the other hand, Ibuprofen served as a mild analgesic as also inhibited OTM with its anti-inflammatory effect. © 2019, Indian Journal of Public Health Research and Development.

METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study involving the acquisition of measured AMH levels from patient records dating October 2012- October 2014 (N=250). AMH levels determined by laboratory values were obtained. Data were stratified by age groups (25-29, 30-35, 35-39, 40+). Each dataset was represented as an AMH value at a single time point to determine median, mean and standard deviation for each group. Percentage of change for values were calculated comparing to previous corresponding age group and each group to 25-29 (subset 1) to evaluate declining trend. RESULTS: A total of 250 records were evaluated. The data was segregated into 4 different age groups and their means, medians, and standard deviations were calculated individually. Age group 25-29 AMH values with a mean of 4.94, a standard deviation of 3.17, and a median of 4.75. Age group 30-34 AMH values: mean 4.30, standard deviation 5.63, and median 3.2. Age group 35-39 AMH values: mean 2.58, standard deviation 4.83, median 1.3. Age group 40 + AMH values: mean 1.29, standard deviation 1.54, median 0.85. Results showed a reduction of 47.7% and 73.8% when values of AMH were calculated for ages 35-39 and 40+ and compared to 25-29 years, respectively. CONCLUSION: The results demonstrate AMH levels among Puerto Rican women presenting to a fertility clinic supporting a decline of AMH with advancing age."

It usually affects both the soft tissue and hard tissue surrounding the dental implants. Studies have shown the prevalence rates of dental implants to be around 56%(1,2). There are several risk factors predisposing a patient with a dental implant to periimplantitis. Some of these include systemic diseases such as diabetes mellitus, immunosuppressive disorders etc., habits such as smoking and alcoholism, poor oral hygiene and improper maintenance of the dental implant. Although a proper protocol has not been found to treat periimplantitis, several conservative and surgical approaches are used to treat periimplantitis. The baseline of treatment is improving the oral hygiene by means of mechanical cleaning and the usage anti-infective oral rinses(2,3). Laser and photodynamic therapy have been found to yield excellent results in the treatment of periimplantitis and have come into light in the recent years.

The enormous benefits of breast feeding have been well documented over the years. However its association with early childhood caries (ECC) has been a constant subject of debate. The etiology of ECC is multifactorial thus posing a difficulty in attributing the risk towards a single factor. The increased duration and frequency of breastfeeding along with poor dietary habits and oral hygiene practices have been reported as contributing factors for ECC. Certain constituents of breast milk have an inhibitory effect on Streptococcus mutans, the major organism implicated in the initiation of ECC. Awareness of ECC and its preventive strategies should be emphasized to young mothers along with the importance of nutrition obtained from breast milk and the benefits of breast feeding.

Recently, nanomedicines provide a potential benefit to breast cancer treatment by their increased bioavailability, selective targeting, increased efficacy and lower toxicity. This work aimed to evaluate the cytotoxic potential of A. annua silver nanoparticles (AGNPs) on human triple-negative breast cancer cell lines. The mechanism by which A.annua AGNPs exhibit growth inhibition was analysed by using the status of LDH, Mitochondria Membrane potential [MMP], and ATP levels. Finally, the ability of A. annua AGNPs to mediate cell death was studied by protein expressions of Bax, BCL-2, Caspase 3and Caspase 9. We observed that A. annua AGNPs show a remarkable cytotoxic effect by increasing levels of LDH with loss of MMP and reduced ATP levels. Here in this study, protein expression of Bax, BCL-2 ratio, Cyt C and Caspase 9 protein expression level favors apoptotic induction during AGNPs treatment. Henceforth we prove that A.annua AGNPs can be useful as alleviative regiment against breast cancer and can be explored for other cancers and its related pathologies. © 2019, Indian Journal of Public Health Research and Development.

Despite its wide distribution and ecological amplitude, blackgum is an underutilized tree species in fire history reconstructions within its range. In this study, I analyzed cross-section samples collected from 19 fire-scarred blackgum trees at a dry, nutrient-poor ridgetop study area in northeastern Pennsylvania. All but two of these samples were successfully crossdated, each containing between one and six fire scars. Fires recorded by blackgum occurred frequently, with site-level mean fire intervals between approximately three and five years. There was an increase in blackgum growth within two years following fire events, but this increase was not statistically significant and it was dependent on local fire regime characteristics. In addition, the blackgum fire-scar data increased the temporal and spatial resolution of an existing local fire history. These results provide evidence for the potential use of blackgum in fire history reconstructions, but applications may be limited by tree age, complacent growth that prevents crossdating, and the degree of rot resistance after scarring. © 2019 by the author.

Differentiating Ph +ve AML from CML in blast crisis is an ongoing challenge. In our study, we tried to differentiate between both categories and determine the prevalence of this rare entity as well as its clinical and laboratory features. Patients and Method: We enrolled in our study 175 patients from the National Cancer Institute, Egypt; Conventional Karyotyping and qualitative RT PCR for BCR/ABL fusion proteins were done for all the patients. Positive cases were confirmed by FISH. Results: Five/175 patients were shown to have BCR/ABL translocation with an incidence of 2.8%. Four out of the five cases were having fusion protein p210 by RT PCR, while the fifth case was having neither p210 nor p190. Most criteria of differentiation were intermingling together. Conclusion: Further studies should be done to confirm or exclude this provisional entity. Moreover, introduction of BCR/ABL analysis in the routine may be a useful tool for introducing TKIs in these patients, which may improve the survival. © 2019, Indian Journal of Public Health Research and Development.

Breast cancer was induced in adult female albino rats by injection of DMBA (50 mg/kg b. wt.). After 15 weeks, animals and divided into four groups. One group did not receive any treatment and served as a tumor group. The other three groups were injected with concanavalin A (of 20 mg/kg b. wt.) or D609 (50 mg / kg b. wt.) or both components together for a period of 8 weeks. At the end of experimental period, animals of control and treated groups were sacrificed and samples of breast tissues were obtained and prepared for analysis of the apoptotic markers Bcl-2 (B -cell leukemia/ lymphoma 2), Bim (BcL2 interacting mediator), Bax (Bcl-2 associated X protein), Caspase 9, and Caspase 3. The results exhibited highly significant changes in apoptotic markers in cancer group as compared to normal control group, mainly represented by the increased levels of Bcl-2 and decreased levels of Bim, Bax and caspases 3 and 9. On the other hand, concanavalin A and D609 treatments induced significant modulatory effects on these markers. They induced significant decrease in Bcl-2 levels and increase in Bim, Bax and caspases 3 and 9 levels in all treated groups as compared to the DBMA-tumor group. These ameliorative changes were highly significant in the group of animals exposed to co-treatment of both materials. To conclude: the present study provides evidence that concanavalin A and D609 enhance apoptotic activity in DMBA-induced breast cancer in rats and suggests that the use of combination of the two therapies is recommended in the treatment of breast cancer. © 2019, Indian Journal of Public Health Research and Development.

The efficacy of immediate implant placement has been established and shown to be predictable if reasonable guidelines are followed. The reasons for tooth extraction may include but not limit to: insufficient crown to root ratios, remaining root length, periodontal attachment levels, periodontal health of teeth adjacent to the proposed implant sites, unrestorable caries, root fractures with large endodontic posts and questionable teeth in need of endodontic retreatment. The most esthetically challenging in implant placement is the maxillary anterior region. The reason being that tooth loss leads to resorption of bone and collapse in gingival architecture leading to esthetic compromise and inadequate bone for implant placement. Also, the advantages of placing Immediate implant into freshly extracted socket reduces the treatment time, cost, and increases the patient comfort.

This increase has also been accompanied by rapid growth of slums in cities. The 2011 Census of India reveals that 17.4% of urban households in India live in slums This survey was conducted in the urban slum area of Anandapet, Guntur. Objective: estimating the quality of drinking water, storage method at household level and waste disposal of both solid and sewage in that area and also to estimate chlorine levels in the drinking water consumed by the residents in the wake of the recent GE (gastroenteritis) epidemic in Guntur. Methodology: A community based Cross-sectional study was carried out during May to June 2018 with the objective of estimating the quality of drinking water, storage method at household level and waste disposal of both solid and sewage in that area. Results: 77(38.5%) houses do not follow any method of disinfection of water. Whereas 70(35%) houses follow boiling. 38(19%) houses use filter, and 15(7.5%) use water purifier for disinfection of water. Among those 70 houses that boil the water, 59 houses use different well maintained vessel for storage of boiled water and 11 houses use same vessel for storage of boiled water. Conclusions: Majority of the households in the study area had access to improved source of drinking water. But a few households practiced unhealthy storage and treatment practices like cleaning the overhead tank/ sumps once a month or once in 15 days, not treating water prior to consumption, dipping the glass into the water drum. Absence of free chlorine suggests the need for attention by the concerned authorities and the households. © 2019, Indian Journal of Public Health Research and Development. All rights reserved."

Therefore there was a need to evaluate the changes in autonomic dysfunction with increasing BMI in patients with COPD. Objective: The aims of this study were 1) to compare autonomic dysfunction in patients with COPD with increasing BMI, 2) to correlate autonomic dysfunction in patients with COPD with increasing BMI. Methodology: In the present study, 42 subjects were categorized into underweight, normal weight, overweight and obese category. Non invasive cardiac autonomic function tests were carried out in these subjects. Results: The mean ± SD age of underweight, normal weight, overweight, and obese patients with COPD were 57.667 ± 5.1640, 61.007 ±8.8991, 55.800±6.6106 and 56.200±7.1204 respectively. It was found that there was no correlation between BMI and autonomic dysfunction responses in patients with COPD. All four cardiac autonomic function test came out to be non significant statistically [Karl Pearson correlation (r), ns-p >0.05]. Multiple comparisons between underweight, normal weight, overweight, and obese patients with COPD for cardiac autonomic responses, FEV1, PEF were statistically non significant.

To appreciate these it is first necessary to understand two related concepts. First, complaints of dry mouth (or xerostomia) may not reflect reduced salivary function may instead reflect dehydration or other systemic conditions. Therefore studies that only examine the complaints of dry mouth will not reflect the true risk for oral diseases in the population. Second, it is very difficult to determine values for normal salivary function. Other studies suggest that salivary flow rates in elders are related to the number of medications they take on a regular basis, time number of systemic disorders they report, and the length of time for which they consume the drugs. © 2019, Indian Journal of Public Health Research and Development.

These studies investigated how transformative learning could be incorporated as a tool on existing Health Information system (HIS) to assist healthcare professionals. The study employed a case study approach in collecting data. Data was collected using semi-structured open-ended interviews. It was revealed that structured learning programs or tools were necessary but not available to facilitate the implementation of learning new research outcomes despite the hospitals having some standalone HIS in place. Based on the findings the researcher proposed an Integrated Health Information System framework (IHISF) which was underpinned by transformative teaching and learning theory and tool. This is to assist physicians in remote hospitals to learn and implement newly published research findings in their practices.

Consequently, India hosts nearly 20% of the world’s population of young girls in age of 14 to 21years, and each and every one of them has the potential to contribute to India’s future economy1. Yet, work participation rates for women remain dismally low1. Denying girls the opportunity to finish their schooling and build income-generating skills, keeps them from realizing their economic potential3. Life skills development empowers learners to observe the process involving “what to do, why to do, how to do and when to do”. It encompasses the ability to build sound, harmonious relationships with self, others and the environment, the ability to act responsibly and safely, the ability to survive under a variety of conditions, and the ability to solve problems4. Aim: To measure the level of life skills in young girls working in organized sectors, Coimbatore. Results: The statistical measure of central tendency the mean age of the respondents is 17.42 years and there is no difference between the mean median and mode. Regarding the global score of life skills, the majority (40.8%) of the respondents had average level of life skills. There is significant association between education level of the respondents and their life skills levels, between experience and of problem solving skill of the respondents, association between educational qualification and of coping with stress level of the respondents. Conclusion: Through this study it is evident that majority of the respondents had only average level of life skills. And it is understood that majority of the respondents had average level of life skills, so this is the main reason for young girls to become vulnerable in working environment. Vulnerable in the form of low wages, over work load, verbal abuse and suffering from occupational hazards. Through the promotion of life skill education to these young girls their quality of life and quality of work environment can be improved. © 2019, Indian Journal of Public Health Research and Development.

Variability is the law of nature because of infinite number of genetic possibilities present. No individuals are ever exactly alike. The growth factor is a critical variable in orthodontic diagnosis and treatment planning. Predicting the out come of treatment results in a growing patient is often more difficult than in a non growing patient. Prior knowledge of the amount along with rate, timing and direction of maxilla–mandibular growth in any given patient would be extremely useful for forecasting treatment out come. Skillfull evaluation of growth left in a patient makes a difference in such growth modulations. Having an intrinsic indicator could be a boon for the clinician. Hence the search for such an intrinsic indicator was initiated in this study. © 2019, Indian Journal of Public Health Research and Development. All rights reserved."

Although many women achieve lower and middle management positions, they seem to hit the “glass ceiling” in many organizations and are denied the most senior levels of upper management. The reasons are multi-dimensional; some women lack the confidence to apply for senior positions; some lack the necessary education or training; and others find themselves excluded from the top positions because of systemic gender bias that exists in some companies. There are plenty of statistics tracking the percentage of women in the workforce, their qualifications and their salaries. But the data doesn’t show us the whole picture. It doesn’t assess how women feel, how they fare in their day-to-day business, the challenges they encounter.

One of them uses chromium sulfate as a tanner. Various studies have shown that there are health problems in tanning workers if exposed to chromium. The purpose of this study is to find out the relationship between resting patterns and levels of chromium in the blood of workers. Using a cross sectional design, there were 10 workers studied specifically handling the tanner’s process with a minimum ten-year tenure. The results showed that all respondents had chromium levels exceeding the standard according to Jantzen namely 1.6 µg/L-5.1 µg/L. The pattern of rest includes staying up late has a weak correlation with the levels of chromium in the blood, total rest also has a weak correlation with the levels of chromium in the blood, as well as rest at night. The metabolic process in the body plays a role in removing chromium toxins as long as workers carry out adequate resting activities. In conclusion, exposure to chromium during the tanning process causes high levels of chromium in the blood. The existence of a weak correlation between the break pattern variables shows that these variables do not affect significantly. Suggestions that workers use personal protective equipment so as to minimize exposure to chromium and take advantage of rest periods optimally. © 2019, Indian Journal of Public Health Research and Development.

Background: Facial asymmetries exist in all individuals. It is commonly stated that the right side of the face is not an ideal replica of the left side. Facial asymmetry can be associated with different types of malocclusion and growth patterns. Significant facial asymmetry causes both functional as well as aesthetic problems. Hence this study was undertaken to evaluate the prevalence of asymmetry in patients reporting for orthodontic treatment. Materials and Method: This study was conducted on 162 patients in the Department of Orthodontics, Saveetha Dental College and Hospitals, Chennai, within the age group of 14 to 26 years. Extra-oral photographs of the frontal view of patients were taken in a standardised manner. The Rule of fifth was modified and a midline was marked through the sagittal section of the face. The parts on the left and right side of the face were measured in pixels and compared. The deviations were noted in each part and statistically analysed to correlate with the type of malocclusion and growth pattern. Results: All the three parts in the face were not equal on either side. Facial asymmetry was more concentrated on the lateral part when compared to the other two parts. Asymmetry is seen more in patients with class II malocclusion, horizontal and average growth patterns when compared to other malocclusion and growth patterns. © 2019, Indian Journal of Public Health Research and Development.

While breastfeeding provides optimal nutrition to the child and prevent infections, the timely initiation and age appropriate complementary feeding can substantially reduce stunting and related burden of disease. Poor hygiene and subsequent diarrhea may also contribute to stunting through chronic gut inflammation. Objective: To study the knowledge and hygiene practices among mothers during infant and young child feeding. Methodology: A cross-sectional study was conducted in the urban field practice area of Navodaya Medical College. A study population of 375 mothers having children of less than two years age were selected by systematic random sampling method. Data was collected after informed consent regarding socio-demographic factors, knowledge and hygiene practices during child feedingfrom mothers. Data was analyzed using EPI Info 7 and expressed in terms of percentages, proportions. Results: The study showed 50.1% of mothers had correct knowledge on duration of exclusive breastfeeding and 42.7% on appropriate time of initiating complementary feeding. 28.35% of mothers had the habit of washing hands with soap and water before feeding the child. Only 12.8% of mothers had given safe water for drinking to child. Conclusion: In our study half of the mothers had the right knowledge on appropriate duration of exclusive breastfeeding while knowledge on initiation of complementary feeding is much less. Hygiene practices are very low and needs more attention. © 2019, Indian Journal of Public Health Research and Development. All rights reserved."

It has been increasing at an alarming speed and there is a need to search for new and better diagnostic tools for its early and effective diagnosis. The current diagnostic tools include mammography, MRI, and FNAC. In this regard, cytogenetic analysis of breast cancer using standard Lymphocyte Culture Technique 1 can be proved as a powerful and cost-effective tool to identify women with high risk of developing Breast Cancer. The technique can be used to study the altered chromosomal pattern in terms of its number or structure owing to its diseased condition that might be specific to Breast Cancer. In the present study, peripheral blood from breast cancer as well as healthy females were taken and subjected to cytogenetic analysis and studying their structural and numerical aberrations.

Periodontal augmentation with bone graft provides structural integrity to the periodontium minimising occurrence of tell-tale relapse. Selective decortication and bone autograft augmentation were the procedures advocated for the accelerated correction of the skeletal maxillary bilateral posterior crossbite and open bite malocclusion in the case reported. A-18-year-old female patient presented with a mild skeletal Class III malocclusion with increased bi-maxillary dento-alveolar protrusion, anterior open bite, forward tongue posture and imbricated and rotated mandibular incisors with maxillary bilateral posterior crossbite. A nonextraction treatment plan was recommended. Method: A week subsequent to strapping of pre-adjusted edgewise appliance, MBT prescription (0.022 x 0.028-inch slot) and Hyrax device, full thickness mucoperiosteal flaps were reflected in the maxillary buccal regions. Decortication was done with surgical perforations and augmented with bone autograft taken from the symphyseal region of the patient. Two weeks later activation of the Hyrax device was done twice daily with the other orthodontic adjustments performed fortnightly untill completion of treatment. Results: Rapid correction of the skeletal maxillary bilateral posterior crossbite was achieved in 2.5 months and the complete malocclusion was treated in 7 months. Conclusion: The accelerated correction of the malocclusion could be attributed to the regional acceleratory phenomenon triggered by the intentional surgical insult effected by the decortication procedure and the stable result thus observed was attributed to the periodontal augmentation by the bone autograft. © 2019, Indian Journal of Public Health Research and Development.

Aim and Objective: The present study was designed to elucidate the knowledge and practice of current regulatory requirements for the members of ethics committee (EC), amongst dental colleges in India. Materials and Method: A cross sectional survey was conducted amongst the ethics committee members of various post graduate dental colleges representing North, South, East, West and Central zones. A validated closed questionnaire was framed in accordance with the Schedule Y of Drugs and Cosmetic Rules 1945 and Indian-GCP guidelines, which was sent through an e-survey using Google forms. Results: The response rate was found to be 40%. Less than 50% participants correctly answered about guidelines of biomedical research, composition of EC, serious adverse effect and vulnerable population. 16.3% of the participants had registered EC and only 28.7% applied universal ethical principles. Conclusion: Despite the presence of ethics committee in the dental institute, the knowledge and practice regarding current regulatory requirements was found to be insufficient for proper functioning. © 2019, Indian Journal of Public Health Research and Development.

Endodontic infections have received much less attention, despite the fact that many of microbial pathogens are common in those 2 diseases. Many of the systemic diseases were found to affect the outcome of endodontic treatment.A number of observational studies and a longitudinal cohort studyhave described, at least in part, a possible association between systemic involvement and endodontic periapical infection. To date, the role of systemic medical conditions as a modulating factor in the development of endodontic periapical infection has been a subject of controversy with authors who found a strong association and those who found weak to no association.

It usually spreads through the air & attacks low immune bodies. Recently, several techniques are applied to diagnosis the TB diseases. Unfortunately, diagnosing TB is still a major challenge. In recent years, a variety of techniques have been developed. In this paper, texture feature set is obtained using three different categories like statistical, structural and gray level dependent features. After that, the feature selection scheme is carried out and TB classification is done using GANN classifier. In GA-NN, genetic algorithm and neural network are combined to do the classification process. Once the abnormal TB is classified via GA-NN classifier, the TB region is identified via morphological operator. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms than the existing method. © 2019, Indian Journal of Public Health Research and Development. All rights reserved."

The mechanisms of inflammation occurring in acne are now a subject of intense investigation. The T-lymphocyte function is altered in AV together with the cytokines produced by T-cell subsets, hence implicated in the immunopathogenesis of AV. The role of T Helper 17 cells (Th17) in the pathogenesis of AV has not been established. Objective: Study the level of expression of Th17 cytokine (IL-17) in tissue of patients of AV with both inflammatory and non-inflammatory lesions. Method: 50 patients with AV as well as 30 age and sex matched healthy controls were included. Clinical examination was done and tissue levels of IL-17 were measured by ELISA. Results: The mean tissue levels of IL-17 were significantly higher in patients than in controls (p < 0.001). A statistically significant relation was found between tissue levels of IL-17 and the type of lesion; where the mean levels of IL-17 were statistically significant in patients with both inflammatory (papules & pustules) and non-inflammatory type (comedones) of AV but was found statistically higher in inflammatory type. Conclusion: Th17 cells potentially play a role in the pathogenesis of AV.

It is estimated that 15% to 20% of all pregnant women will experience a high-risk state and obstetric complication. The evidence-based comprehensive guideline provided by the midwife is expected to detect early risk factors for pregnancy, labour, and postpartum before complication occurs. The early detection system through risk factor assessment using the scoring system requires too much time to make being referred to. Risk management cannot be used to be rule for midwives, and pregnant women and their families have not been well enough informed about the mother’s risk requirement. The purpose of this research is to build an early detection system in the midwife private practice of the Central Lampung regency to detect early pregnancy, labour, and post-childbirth to perform risk assessment, to provide risk management as needed, and to design a database of pregnant mothers to be able to produce a report of maternal service. This research uses a prototyping approach as the basis for system development. The early detection system enables midwives to assess the health of pregnant, maternal, and post-childbirth women; perform case management; provide information needed by pregnant women and families; and facilitate midwives in recording and delivering a quality report. © 2019, Indian Journal of Public Health Research and Development.

Over half of the patients examined every day may have enlarged lymph nodes in the head and neck region. Oral health care providers must able to determine when lymphadenopathy should be investigated further since it has a high frequency of occurrence. But it is the duty of the clinician to search for a precipitating cause and examine other nodal locations to exclude generalized lymphadenopathy. Generally lymph node larger than 1 cm in diameter is considered as an abnormal lymph node. Malignancy should be considered when palpable lymph nodes are identified in the supraclavicular region, or when nodes are rock hard, rubbery, or fixed in consistency. Patients with unexplained localized cervical lymphadenopathy presenting with a benign clinical picture should be observed for a 2-to 4-week period.

The most widely accepted hypothesis in its pathogenesis is that it is a T-cell-mediated autoimmune condition in genetically predisposed individuals. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are implicated in disease etiology and treatment. Interestingly, miRNAs 31, 155 and 29c have shown an important role in alopecia areata. Since miRNA can be used as serum biomarker in other autoimmune diseases. This study aimed to assess and compare serum levels of miRNAs 31, 155 and 29c in 50 AA patients with their levels in 50 healthy subjects & correlate their levels to severity of AA. Serum levels of miRNAs 31, 155 and 29c were estimated by qRT-PCR technique and miRNAs 31 and 29c were found to be significantly higher in AA patients compared to controls. MicroRNA 155 however, showed no significant difference between serum levels of AA patients compared to controls.

The rate of new infections is the greatest in the younger age group between 18-35 years of age with women being more infected than men1. In the absence of a cure for the disease, the mainstay of clinical management involves adherence to lifelong anti-retro viral (ARV) therapy4. Another integral component in trying to decrease new HIV infections is enhancing HIV-AIDS prevention modalities. These approaches have grown through the years and range from local to systemic forms either singly or in combination with other therapies4. An emerging potentially viable option is Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) (5). This form of therapy is the ingestion of a type of ARV on a daily basis by an HIV-Negative individual to remain HIV free. There are several clinical trials ongoing and past that have shown efficacy for use in adults and primarily in young adults. The rollout of PrEP as prevention modality globally has commenced and South Africa stands on the brink of roll out for high risk and young adults through the South African Department of Health ARV treatment programme. It is thus imperative that a study to explore the level of knowledge and awareness of HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) as an HIV prevention modality among young adults occurs in order to assess readiness for implementation in order to identify potential challenges with recommendations for smart practices. © 2019, Indian Journal of Public Health Research and Development.

Associations between mastication and glucose metabolism in diabetics have been shown in previous studies. However, the association between mastication and BSL in pre-diabetes has not been clarified. Our objective was to examine association between frequency of chewing and BSL in prediabetes population-based cohort. Method: On attaining Institutions ethical committee clearance, considering all inclusion and exclusion criteria and after taking informed consent, we conducted a cross-sectional study in 95 prediabetic individuals. Subjects recruited to study received a fixed calorific load of 150 calories in form of 25 grams of groundnuts on two successive days. We decided to use groundnuts as substrate for our study as we hypothesized this would result in elevated cephalic phase insulin secretion, since it requires thorough mastication for deglutition and is rich in protein (26%), fat (49%) but little carbohydrate (16%), of which >50% is insoluble fiber. On Day 1 subjects were observed as they were chewing at their routine habituated rates without them being conscious that they are being observed while on Day 2 they were asked to chew each bolus forty times before swallowing. Postprandial BSL were estimated, all parameters and their obtained values were scrutinized on both days and data was statistically analyzed. Results: On comparing the mean post prandial BSL between normal chewing versus 40 time chewing, statistically significant decrease was observed with respect to 40 chews per bolus (p < 0.000). Conclusions: These findings support hypothesis that when in pre-diabetic individuals a simple yet effective method of thorough mastication will decrease postprandial BSL vis–a-vis faster chewing and swallowing. © 2019, Indian Journal of Public Health Research and Development.

Fabrication of complete dentures involves clinical and laboratory procedures that should be performed precisely for achieving success with fabricated dentures. These occlusal errors can be corrected, (1) in a patient’s mouth or (2) by recording new centric relation and remounting dentures on an articulator. The second method is more viable because the denture base moves over the oral mucosa which is unable to identify premature contacts in centric occlusion and tooth guided eccentric excursions.This article depicts the modest and effective clinical chairside remounting procedure. © 2019, Indian Journal of Public Health Research and Development.

The disability condition will make the workers experience substantial limitations from every side of their life both in a social context and economic context 1, the dependence to their family 2, inability to live independently 3. The disability can also cause the workers to lose their job 4. The bad financial condition and the dependence give a negative impact on the quality of life of the workers with disabilities. The aim of this research was to analyze the influence of independence toward the quality of life. Method: This research used a cross-sectional method. The population of this research was the workers with disabilities caused by an occupational accident in Sidoarjo Regency and Gresik Regency. The number of samples in this research was 182 participants. The sampling technique was done by using simple random sampling technique. The variables that were analyzed were the characteristic of the individual, the independence, and the quality of life. The measurement instrument for independence was done using Lawton-Browdy instrumental activities of daily living scale; the measuring instrument for the quality of life was done using WHOQol100 questionnaire (a standardized questionnaire). The data analysis was done using linear regression test with a significance level (α) of 0.05. Results: Nearly 78% of participants had independence in the ‘moderate’ category with an average score of 81.51. The 78% of participants also had the quality of life in the ‘moderate’ category. Based on the regression test, it was obtained a result that the independence had a significant impact on the quality of life of workers with disabilities caused by occupational accident (p < 0.05). Conclusion: The independence has a significant impact on the quality of life of workers with disabilities caused by an occupational accident. The better the worker’s independence is, the better the quality of life of the worker with a disability caused by an occupational accident is. © 2019, Indian Journal of Public Health Research and Development.

The paper tries to explore the introduction of a healthy western cuisine to the Indian audience through the books of Enid Blyton. As many have noted, Enid Blyton in her books provide a rather healthy diet and also manages to make it appealing to the children. Her characters do not gorge themselves on junk food, but eat balanced, nutritious food. This multidisciplinary dialogue between literature and health shapes the perceptions of the young generation towards a healthier lifestyle. Enid spelt backwards is dine, a happy coincidence to generations upon generations who grew up reading Blyton’s stories. Her books, with an enduring appeal that reigns the bookshelves, is subtly centered around cultural caricatures through culinary delights irrespective of the story. An a la carte of high teas, picnic lunches and midnight feasts-commonplace in the Enid Blyton menu-vivified tastefully, result in traditional British cuisine being synonymous with fine dining. Thus, the food becomes an aspirational motif to young readers, who are attracted to not just the imperial culinary traditions, but also to the British lifestyle, of which the delicious food is only a subset.The paper explores this interplay between food and the literature, paying careful attention to how a healthy diet is prioritised in Blyton’s stories. © 2019, Indian Journal of Public Health Research and Development.

Fisher’s exact analysisand Chi-square test was used to calculate statistical significance. Results: Present study showed Saphenousvein as most frequent among all veins. Prominent veins and aching were most frequent symptoms in varicose veins. Chi square analysis revealed significant difference between frequency of symptoms among male and female patients (χ2= 16.221*, df= 6, p value= 0.01). Forty two percent patients showed variable complications associated with varicose veins symptoms. Conclusion: Symptoms in early varicose veins were minimal and they became severe with time. One must know early symptoms of this disease to avoid complications in the later stage. More importantly, varicose risk factors should be taken care of before appearance of symptoms. © 2019, Indian Journal of Public Health Research and Development. All rights reserved."

The epidemiological transition from communicable diseases to Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) and Cardiovascular diseases(CVDs) being a leading cause of death calls for prevention of CVDs which will be the essential step to control the epidemic of NCDs. The aim of this study is to estimate the cardiovascular risk among adults aged ≥40 years, utilizing WHO/ISH risk charts. Method: A community based cross-sectional study conducted among 250 individuals aged ≥40 years residing in urban area ofMysuru, Karnataka. Study participantswere personally interviewed using a semi-structured questionnaire. Information regarding anthropometric measurements and laboratory investigations were also collected. The 10-year risk for cardiovascular events was estimated using the WHO/ISH risk prediction charts. Results: Among 250 study participants, the mean age was 52.7 (+9.5) years and majority were females (69.6%). 25.6% had very high (≥40%) risk, 18% had 10-<20% risk, 23.2% had 20–<30% risk and 8% had 30–<40% estimated risk of developing fatal and non-fatal CVD event in next 10 years. The prevalence of risk factors like Hypertension, Diabetes, Hypercholesterolemia, Moderate Stress and Physical Inactivity were 49.2%, 28.8%, 24.4%, 45.6% and 8.8% respectively. Over-nutrition was more prevalent where 34.4% and 27.2% had class I obesity and class II obesity respectively. Conclusion: There was a high prevalence of CVD risk factors and estimated risk of CVD are significantly prevalent in the urban population. Simple tool like WHO/ISH risk prediction charts can be used as a screening tool to estimate the CVD risk occurrence in next 10 years, in a low resource country like India, even at a community level. © 2019, Indian Journal of Public Health Research and Development.

Method: This study included 30 patients (mean age 55.1) suffering from ED for more than 1 year. They were non-responders to oral phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors. Before initial therapy by PRP, all patients were subjected to history taking, examination and evaluation of erectile function (EF) using an abridged Arabic version of International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-5). Additionally, patients were evaluated by Penile Color Doppler Ultrasonography (PCDUS). ICI of PRP was done once per week for 2 months.Follow up of EF and penile hemodynamics included evaluation of patients by IIEF-5 at 1, 2, 3 months and PCDUS at 3 months after initiation of therapy. Results: IIEF-5 score showed significant improvement at 1, 2 and 3 months after PRP injection. The injections improved the penile hemodynamics on both sides such that, the right peak systolic velocity (PSV), end diastolic velocity (EDV) and diameter of cavernosal artery differed after treatment compared to pre treatment levels (p value 0.012, 0.002 and 0.000) respectively. Also, PRP therapy improved the left side PSV, EDV and cavernosal artery diameter but the difference was statistically significant only in the left cavenosal EDV and cavernosal artery diameter (p value 0.002 and 0.000) respectively. Moreover, the results revealed a significant difference between response to ICI before and after treatment (p value 0.028). Also, the treatment was well tolerated and no major side effects were reported. Conclusion: ICI of PRP could improve erectile function, penile hemodynamics, response to ICI, patient satisfaction and might be a salvage treatment for patients with severe erectile dysfunction who failed response to medical treatment. © 2019, Indian Journal of Public Health Research and Development.

The quality of bone is one of the most crucial factors that affects primary implant stability. Sufficient bone to implant contact [BIC] is an essential criterion for biomechanically stable dental implant. Osseodensification, a recently developed technique has been at the forefront of evolutionary changes in osteotomy site preparation in implantology. This technique involves low plastic deformation of bone that is created by rolling and sliding contact using a densifying bur that is fluted such that it densifies the bone with minimal heat elevation. This technique has been proposed to help in better osteotomy preparation, bone density and increases primary implant stability. Method: A literature review was done to analyse the osseodensification procedure, its advantages over conventional osteotomy on bone density and primary implant stability. Conclusion: Densifying drills [Densah] for bone osseodensification resulted in undersized osteotomy compared to conventional drills. It also resulted in improved bone density and increase in percentage bone volume and bone to implant contact, thereby improving implant stability. © 2019, Indian Journal of Public Health Research and Development.

It was intended to find out self-reported health concerns for the duration of one month and cardiovascular risk factors in older adults. Method: In a cross-sectional survey attendees of a Healthy Ageing Conference were approached with a semi-structured questionnaire about their health concerns and cardiovascular risks. Risk of cardiovascular event in 10 years based on QRISK3 was calculated. Results: A considerable proportion of elderly had range of physical symptoms, depressive mood state and memory problems. Mean number of health problems reported were 4.8±3.3 (male 4.4±3.1 and female 5.0±4.3). Cardiovascular risk was high, mean QRISK3 score for males were 22.2% (±14.4) and for females 10.3% (±6.6) (p<0.05). On an average the heart age was increased by 7.9±6.2 years (8.6±6.6 years for males and 5.0±3.3 for females). The relative risk was 2.1 for males and 1.5 for females. The symptoms and risk factors were elicited easily and the process probably facilitated improving the awareness about the health concerns holistically. Conclusions: The results suggested the extent of health concerns in general and cardiovascular risks in particular and may help to reflect about required range of appropriate public health awareness and intervention programmes in the community. © 2019, Indian Journal of Public Health Research and Development.

Advanced surgical procedures such as bone grafting, sinus lifting, and nerve repositioning are required to overcome this condition and make implant treatment possible for such patients. Short implants are considered as a viable alternative in patients with reduced alveolar bone height to avoid more invasive surgical procedures. They simplify the implant treatment, reduce patient morbidity, shorten the duration of treatment, and make it less expensive. With the improvements in the surface topography of implants, which increase the bone implant contact, and use of adapted surgical protocols similar survival rates as that of regular implants have been reported even with short implants. © 2019, Indian Journal of Public Health Research and Development.

Approaches to the subject have, however, varied in different periods during the last over 50 years. In the initial years of development planning, unemployment was not expected to emerge as a major problem. Yet care was taken to see that employment of a reasonable magnitude is generated in the development process to productively employ the growing labour force. A reasonably high rate of economic growth combined with an emphasis on labour intensive sectors like the small scale industry was envisaged to achieve this goal. To analyze the trend and to estimate the growth rates of the employment in different organized sectors of India, simple linear regression model and semi-log linear regression model have been fitted respectively to the data on the organized sector for the periods 1990-91 to 2009-10. The estimated value of the regression co-efficient, their standard error and other important results are given. Employment in mining and quarrying sector increased by 0.072 lakh persons per year.

Materials and Method: This study was both retrospective and prospective covering a period from 2001 to 2018. The pattern of bear maul injuries in term of time, location, provocation, animal/human group behavior and the injury type/distribution were recorded and analyzed. Results: Only a total of 27 cases were registered in 17 years. All the injuries were caused by Sloth Bears alone. Most of the patients were middle aged to elders. In our study, males were victimized more (74.1%) than females (25.9%). Most of the incidents (66.7%) occurred in early morning time. In our observation 51.9% of accidents happened in croplands and 25.9% in forest. Bear attacks were unprovoked in 81.5% cases.. The face and head were injured in 74.07% cases followed by trunk and upper limb in 70.37% cases. Abdomen and lower limbs were injured in 37% cases. In spite of devastating injuries,mortality was 0 in our study. Conclusion: The relatively low incidence of bear attack in the region of Mount Abu may be an indication of a harmonious man-animal existence. Eliminating the need for open defecation and collection of fire wood by the tribal population can go a long way in further improving the man-animal coexistence equilibrium. © 2019, Indian Journal of Public Health Research and Development.

Approach to intoxication: physostigmine therapy is an alternative to general approach in the treatment of intoxicated patients. However, physostigmine is a generally accepted antidote; it is not always accessible in every region or place. This retrospective study aimed to evaluate HNI cases in which physostigmine were not administered. The study examined the clinical outcomes, the follow-ups after discharge, and the laboratory analyses in order to see the impact of presence and absence of physostigmine administration in the treatment of HNI. Method: 27 patients who presented to the hospital because of HNI intake were included in the study. Laboratory values, hospitalizations and outcomes of the patients were recorded. Patients’ clinical status and admissions to E.R. in the following three-month period after the discharge were examined by having contact with the patients. Results: Although blood values of all the patients were in the normal reference ranges, direct bilirubin and ALT values were higher in the patients hospitalized to intensive care unit. Stomach lavage was applied to all patients and supportive care was started. Any complications including death, intubation and mechanic ventilation were not developed in the patients. All the hospitalized patients were discharged in four days. After the discharge, all the patients were contacted and questioned about whether they had any admissions to E.R., and had any complications or not. It was seen that none of them had a hospital admission associated with HNI. Concerning the findings in our study and the literature in which patients were not administered physostigmine, we can state that instead of administering physostigmine in HNI patients, applying supportive toxicology approach is more accurate. © 2019, Indian Journal of Public Health Research and Development.

The cause of VRF is mainly trauma and iatrogenic reasons. Both complete and incomplete VRF constitute an ongoing problem in dentistry because they are difficult to be diagnosed in the early stages. In majority of the cases, tooth extraction is the only reasonable treatment when the VRF is finally diagnosed. Treatment options included extraction of single rooted teeth, but with the advent of adhesive dentistry. There is a paradigm shift towards preservation of these teeth. © 2019, Indian Journal of Public Health Research and Development. All rights reserved."

Anti-aging process can be emphasised by scheduled exercise programs which enhances beneficiary adaptations in vascular physiology and neurovascular coupling. The mobility function is disturbed due to reduced muscle strength, inappropriate activation of motor units, insufficiency to maintain balance which leads to higher risk offall in the elderly people.Closed kinetic chain exercises control the musculoskeletal system against gravity at rest and in motion thereby protecting the postural stability. PNF has a positive effect on balance and functionality in older adults. Materials and Method: A Quasi experimental study was done for 50 community dwelling elderly people from “Vishranthi Charitable Trust” with mean age of 73±4 years who were selected based on the inclusion criteria. Closed kinetic chain exercises for quadriceps and plantar flexors along with PNF technique such as anterior elevation and posterior depression were given and followed up for 3 weeks. The pretest and post test values were obtained using 6-min walk test, the knee extensor strength measurement and fall risk questionnaire. Result: There was a significant difference in 6-min walk test, fall risk questionnaire p<0.05 in improving the strength of quadriceps and plantar flexors, and there was non-significant difference in the knee extensor strength.

Therefore, Indonesia provides a policy to use contraceptive devices for the population. One contraception used is an IUDs. The concept of the IUD itself has reportedly had a negative impact, especially increasing colonization by Candida spp. due to the content of Curprum (Cu) from the IUD. The purpose of this study was to analyze the relationship between duration of use and type of IUD at blood Cu levels in female workers using an IUD contraception. This research has never been done in Indonesia. The results showed that the majority of respondents used the Copper T type IUD, having an age range between 36-49 years with an average duration of IUD usage of 7.1-7.5 years with a mean value of Cu levels that exceeded the normal cuprum values allowed in the body. The IUD type variable has a moderate correlation between the levels of cuprum in the blood of workers (p = 0.435). The old variable using the IUD has a strong correlation with the cuprum levels in the blood of the respondents (p = 0. 74). Conclusion: The type of IUD and the duration of use of the IUD have a relationship with levels of Cu in the blood. Women who use an IUD are expected to consume foods that have a high content of antioxidants to reduce levels of Cu in the blood. © 2019, Indian Journal of Public Health Research and Development.

The annual percentage of malignant transformation varies as a result of differences in tobacco and dietary habits. For both genders, cancer of the mouth and pharynx ranks sixth overall in the world. In industrialized countries, men are affected two to three times as often as women, largely due to higher use of alcohol and tobacco. Methodology: Archives from the past 2 years (2017-2018) were accessed from Saveetha Dental College. The inclusion criteria was the type of leukoplakia, site affected, age and sex of the patient. The exclusion criteria were the non-tobacco users. The data was collected and statistically analysed. Results: There exists a male predilection to the occurrence of leukoplakia among the screened population. A correlation between gender and leukoplakia had a positive correlation for the male gender and types 1,4 leukoplakia and had a slight positive correlation. Conclusion: The incidence of leukoplakia among tobacco users is high as compared to the non tobacco users. The male population is at a higher risk. More incidences of homogenous and speckled leukoplakia has been reported within the 2 years. © 2019, Indian Journal of Public Health Research and Development. All rights reserved."

The purpose of this study was to assess the quality of life of patients who underwent midfoot amputation. Materials and Method: A quantitative approach with descriptive research design was used for the study. It was conducted among 55 patients who underwent midfoot amputation and were attending the endocrine and podiatry OPD of a tertiary care hospital. Sample selection was done using non-probability convenience sampling technique. The socio-demographic and clinical data were collected by a semi-structured questionnaire and the quality of life was assessed using SF-36 questionnaire. Analysis was done using chi square test. Results: Majority of the subjects (98%) had poor quality of life with a mean score of 31.18±6.62. Among the 8 domains of quality of life, role limitation due to physical health was the poorest with a mean score of 8.19±14.47. Physical component summary (PCS) and mental component summary (MCS) of SF-36 were also poor with mean scores of 29.35±8.60 and 30.72±11.85 respectively. No significant association was found between the quality of life and selected demographic variables of the midfoot amputated patients. Conclusion: The result of the study highlights poor quality of life among midfoot amputated patients. It was also found that the major problem that led to poor quality of life was the role limitation due to physical health. Therefore, there should be more focus on the rehabilitation of patients after midfoot amputation to improve their quality of life. © 2019, Indian Journal of Public Health Research and Development.

These matorral shrublands which dominate the foothills and slopes of the Coastal Mountains and foothills of the Andes in central Chile have received much less study than evergreen shrublands in other mediterranean-type climate regions of the world. Phenological development, growth, and nutrient dynamics of the four widespread matorral shrub species, Lithrea caustica (Anacardiaceae), Colliguaja odorifera (Euphorbiaceae), Kageneckia oblonga (Rosaceae), and Retanilla trinervia (Rhamnaceae), were monitored in central Chile from 1971 to 1975. The four study species all demonstrated growth dynamics and nutrient relations similar to chaparral shrub species of southern California. The species exhibited a sequential development of phenological stages in leaf components following fall precipitation. Colliguaja with relatively shallow root systems showed a sharp peak of new leaf production at the beginning of summer, dropping quickly as summer drought occurred. Another shallow-rooted species while Retanilla initiated leaf production in the late winter, earlier than the other two species, and presented a growth pattern dependent on soil moisture availability. Lithrea and Kageneckia, a more deep-rooted species, initiated leaf production in late spring and continued through the summer. Overall, Chilean shrubs exhibited higher nutrient contents than those of chaparral shrubs in California, suggesting a difference in soil nutrient availability. Reproductive tissues represent a significant portion of the new biomass and nutrient allocation in all four matorral shrubs. Biomass allocation of new tissues (i.e. new leaves, new stems and reproductive tissues) ranged from 8.2% in Retanilla to 16.7% in Colliguaja. Overall, the phenology and nutrient relations of matorral shrubs were similar to those found in chaparral, shrubs indicating that the similar climate regimes can lead to convergence in leaf traits, phenology, and nutrient relationships. © 2019 The author(s).

Methods: The potential and actual dermal exposures for 160 pesticide sprayers performing pesticide spraying task were estimated by using Dermal Exposure Assessment Method (DREAM). Results: Results showed that there was significant difference between nationality (p<0.001), highest education (p<0.001), monthly income (p=0.002), body mass index (p<0.001) and smoking habit (p<0.001) distributions of sprayers in different agriculture subsectors. Various types of pesticides were used by respondents, where class II (moderately hazardous) and class III (slightly hazardous) pesticides were the most frequently used pesticides. There was a significant difference in both tPDE (X2= 118.093, p<0.001) and tADE (X2= 84.980, p<0.001) between different agricultural sectors, where the prominent high tPDE was observed among paddy pesticide sprayers (151.39 ± 22.64 DU) while lowest exposure was recorded among oil palm plantation sprayers (47.67 ± 18.47 DU). Conclusion: Based on DREAM exposure categories, majority of the pesticide sprayers (68.9%) working in paddy farming were exposed in low dermal exposure while 26.7% of respondents were exposed to moderate exposure. Pesticide sprayers in other agriculture sectors were exposed to very low to low exposure level. Dermal exposure distributions on body parts were varied between sectors, influenced by several factors such as crop type, height, and spraying methods. © 2019 UPM Press. All rights reserved."

By financial effect, we mean the ex-ante and ex-post change in the value of an airport under private management, reflected in increase in market capitalization and improvement in financial performance. We look at the granting of a concession for Japan's Sendai Airport, the first such concession to be made by the central government. To measure the ex-ante value, we adopt the event study methodology and statistically test for any rise in the stock price of the concessionaire, Tokyu Corporation, at the announcement of the bidding result. Additionally, we measure the ex-post value by examining any improvement in financial performance and change in the number of passengers after the concession. We find both a positive cumulative abnormal return in the stock and an increase in the number of passengers with statistical significance. This result shows that concessions created value in both ex ante expectations and ex post results. It also suggests that the stock market values private information obtained only by the winner and points to a need for expanded disclosure to level the information field in future bids. The originality and unique value of this paper lie in its applying novel financial perspectives to produce evidence of the positive effects of privatizing infrastructure and in its use of this process to draw policy implications. © 2019 Fabrizio Serra Editore Srl.

In order to assist SMEs to prepare for a flood disaster effectively, the set-up of a disaster preparedness plan is essential. The purpose of this study is to develop a validated instrument for identifying the different levels of disaster preparedness among SMEs in their readiness to face a flood disaster. Methods: In this preliminary study, 26 items of flood disaster preparedness activities (FDPA) reviewed from works of literature were adopted and adapted to be randomly administered to 30 respondents (SME business owners) located in the Temerloh province, Malaysia, which is identified as a flood-prone area. A Rasch analysis technique was used to identify the psychometric properties of the instrument. Results: Using the Rasch measurement analysis technique, the instrument used was able to categorise the SMEs into two level of preparedness: low and moderate. About 25 items were found to possess good psychometric features in determining the flood preparedness level of SMEs despite the lack of items on measuring high-level preparedness activities. Conclusion: The results of this preliminary study have served to highlight the strength of the instrument and gaps identified for further improvement in the near future. © 2019 UPM Press.

The process typically involves three independent design processes - chip, package and PCB - carried out with point tools whose interface requires time-consuming manual processes that are error-prone and limit the potential for reuse. This challenge is being addressed by a new integrated 3D chip/ package/board co-design environment that makes it possible to holistically optimize the package, board and IC design to a greater degree than was possible in the past by considering the system-level impact of each design decision.

Thyroid hormones have a great role in regulating mucosal cells and the growth of the gastrointestinal tract. In this study, we investigated the presence of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection in various types of thyroid disorders. Materials and Methods: Our study included 297 patients whose thyroid status was identified by evaluation of thyroid hormones; triiodothyronine (T3), thyroxine (T4), and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) using Roche Electrochemiluminescence (ECL). H. pylori antibodies and antigen were evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits in all cases. Results: Hypothyroidism had a significant correlation with H. pylori infection (p < 0.001). Hyperthyroidism was not related to H. pylori infection (p = 0.171). Also, in hypothyroidism, female sex more than male sex had a significant correlation with H. pylori infection (p = 0.004). Conclusion: Decreasing thyroid hormones can result in dysregulation of gastric mucosal cells, therefore hypothyroidism can lead to more chance of having H. pylori infection. © 2019 Iranian Association of Gastroenterology and Hepatology.

In this way, we can find them imbricated in religious doctrine, such as the Spiritual War, political activism developed in the so called “public sphere”, but also on other aspects of human experience that are usually perceived as “private” from a liberal perspective, such as sexuality. Religious discourses about the world and humans destiny function as narratives that, being adopted by the faithful, are enacted in different spheres of action. In this way, religion cannot be conceived as a separated dimension of the social world.

Starting from the time-ordered Hamiltonian for the phase of the current which flows across the junction, the propagator, the wave functions, and the joint entropy, which are crucial for quantum analyses of the nano systems, are derived. It is shown that while the propagator and the wave functions vary depending on external driving forces, the joint entropy is not affected from such forces. Interestingly, the probability densities oscillate over time on account of the influence of the time-varying supercurrent in the junction. It is confirmed that if external perturbations on the junction-current are more complicated, the time behaviors of the probability densities become conspicuously irregular. The properties of the joint entropy are also analyzed in detail. Due to damping of the system, the phase(ϕ) component of the joint entropy decreases linearly over time, whereas the conjugate momentum(q) component exhibits linear increase; however, the corresponding joint entropy consequently does not vary. It is demonstrated that the joint entropy obeys the quantum minimum principle, and that there is a close relationship between the joint entropy and the uncertainty relation. © 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Furthermore, there is no clear criteria for the division of subjects of tax relations into types, which makes it impossible to establish the exact scope of participants in tax relations, and to determine the level of their tax legal personality. The purpose of this paper is to determine the scope of participants in tax relations, to analyze and clarify the legal status of established subjects and determine the functions that they perform in tax legal relations, as well as, on the basis of the results obtained, to construct a detailed classification of subjects of tax relations. The key method of scientific research is the method of scientific modelling, because in this article, on the basis of the analysis of existing scientific positions and provisions of legislation, the authors build their own theoretical model of the subject matter, formulate a conceptual apparatus and offer their practical application. This paper examines the subjects of tax relations, examines their types, outlines the limits of their legal personality in tax relations. The analysis of national legislation and various scientific approaches provides for the classification of subjects of tax relations, the legal status and the role they play in the tax mechanism are determined. The paper develops proposals for practical content to improve the provisions of the Tax Code of Ukraine on subjects of tax relations, provides author's definitions of the concept of ‘subjects of tax relations’. The provisions, conclusions, proposals and recommendations formulated in this paper can be used in: lawmaking – to improve and adopt new regulations, to amend existing legislation, to adapt them to the best European and international models; the law enforcement – to improve tax relations with the participation of public authorities; scientific research – for further study of financial and legal issues of participation of public authorities in budget relations; educational process – when teaching the subjects ‘Financial Law’, ‘Tax Law’, ‘Administrative Law’, ‘Topical Problems of Financial Law of Ukraine’ and related training courses. © 2019, by ASERS® Publishing.

Legal theorists seek to answer questions that are devoid of scholastic nature and derive from the practice of real legal relations. The performance of this task involves the movement of fundamental science, which is the general theory of state and law, on the path of ascending from the array of abstract reflections of legal reality, already formed by it, to obtaining its more specific theoretical reproductions. The purpose of this study is to present the correlation of categories such as ‘legal person’ and ‘legal personality’. The relevance of the study lies in the inability to gain new knowledge without the dialectical application of the framework of categories and concepts and methodology of the theory of law to the study of special (e.g., branch) and single (implemented at the individual level) legal phenomena in their relation to the general regularities of the functioning of the state and law.

Hypokalaemia is a rare disorder among healthy pregnant women. Life-threatening muscle and cardiac malfunction may develop if it remains untreated. Objectives. This study was carried out to estimate the prevalence and risk factors of hypokalaemia among pregnant women in rural Eastern Cape (EC) Province, South Africa (SA), and to establish whether geophagia, a common practice, increases the risk. Methods. This cross-sectional analytical study included 188 participants with geophagia and 233 participants without geophagia enrolled at Mthatha Gateway Clinic, EC, SA. Data included sociodemographic characteristics, magnitude of geophagia, dietary patterns and serum potassium levels. The χ2 test for categorical variables, analysis of variance to compare means, multivariate logistic regression for independent risk factors and principal component analysis for latent variable patterns that were associated with hypokalaemia were carried out. P<0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results. Hypokalaemia among pregnant women in rural EC was five times higher than expected. Geophagia accounted for only 15% of the observed cases. The risk of hypokalaemia was higher among primigravidas aged <25 years with low meat, fruit and vegetable consumption who practised geophagia, with concurrent excessive cola or caffeinated soft-drink consumption. Conclusion. Hypokalaemia is disproportionally prevalent among pregnant women in the rural EC. Young age, primigravida, geophagia, diet deficiency in meat, vegetables and fruits and excessive consumption of soft drinks increased the risk of hypokalaemia. The association of geophagia with low meat, vegetable and fruit consumption may indicate an underlying iron deficiency, necessitating further investigation. © 2019, South African Medical Association.

The study of the CCNV will allow us to explore how “the evangelical” and “the Pentecostal” represent floating signifiers (Ernesto Laclau) that can enable a diversity of ritual practices, institutionalization processes, and ethical and political positions within the same spaces of identity. According to the way in which these identities are addressed (theologically and philosophically), the contexts in which they are found and the processes of political articulation in which they are located, the results and practices can differ considerably, even antagonistically. From the approaches in the Argentine academy on the relationship between Pentecostalisms and politics, we will develop a definition of political identity based on the construction of religious identities.

Microcystin-leucine-arginine (MC-LR) is the most potent and most common variant, with a guideline limit of 1 μg/l in drinking water. We previously developed a novel avian single-chain fragment variable (scFv), designated 2G1, for use in an optical-planar waveguide detection system for microcystin determination. This current work investigates interactions between 2G1 and MC-LR at the molecular level through modelling with an avian antibody template and molecular docking by AutoDock Vina to identify key amino acid (AA) residues involved. These potential AA interactions were investigated in vitro by targeted mutagenesis, specifically, by alanine scanning mutations. Glutamic acid (E) was found to play a critical role in the 2G1-MC-LR binding interaction, with the heavy chain glutamic acid (E) 102 (H-E102) forming direct bonds with the arginine (R) residue of MC-LR. In addition, alanine mutation of light chain residue aspartic acid 57 (L-D57) led to an improvement in antigen-binding observed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and was confirmed by surface plasmon resonance (SPR). This work will contribute to improving the binding of recombinant anti-MC-LR to its antigen and aid in the development of a higher sensitivity harmful algal toxin diagnostic. © The Author(s) 2020.

"Analysis of rating positions of insurance companies on international and national markets","2019","Journal of Advanced Research in Law and Economics","0","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85089673678&doi=10.14505%2fjarle.v10.8%2846%29.26&partnerID=40&md5=f432cc52f57b56d36091dafea7556db5","The purpose of the article is to analyze the rating positions of insurance companies. The article explores the development trends at the insurance services market of Ukraine. The paper contains review of the segmentation criteria for insurers according to the ‘The World’s Largest Public Companies’ methodology (diversified insurance, life and health insurance, property insurance and casualty insurance). This rating method applies a set of indicators such as income, sales, assets and market value of the company. The paper identified the leaders in each segment of the international insurance market in 2018. The research findings revealed the absence of Ukrainian companies in the rating because of their low potential and insufficient level of development. The authors conducted analysis of insurers’ positions at the national market in the rating reported by news portal ukrstrahovanie.com.ua. The main ranking approach is multi-factor analysis. This method employs the following indicators: assets; payout level; insurance funds; the share of premium collection from insurance classes; transparency of the insurer's statements. The information for the insurers’ rating was collected from the web-site of Mind business. The rating considers financial stability and business activity of insurance companies as main factors gathered from open public sources. The rating methodology consists of several factors that affect the attractiveness of insurance companies for the customers. The paper developed system of indicators for the rating of insurers in Ukraine according to the journal ‘Insurance TOP’ (insurance classes, economic indicators, business entities). The evidence shows potential for growth of domestic insurance enterprises at the national market but also the rankings confirmed low level of their competitiveness at the international market. © 2019, by ASERS® Publishing.

This document aims to analyze, interpret and describe the behavior of the crimes that occurred during 2018 in Colombia. In this sense it begins with the debate of socioeconomic and public safety aspects of the criminal economy, as well as its impact on the commission of criminal elements. The methodology used focuses on the Principal Components Analysis (PCA), which determines the grouping and concentration of eight crimes nationwide per quarter; then it focuses on 10 capital cities that concentrate 23% of the crimes, finally it does it in the localities of Bogota. Likewise, the criminological analysis is carried out to illustratethe behavior compared to the other factors that affect the criminological juncture. Drawing from the information that lies at the SIEDCO database, statistical exercises were done to establish levels of correlation to study the inertia of criminal indicators in Colombia during the comparative periods of 2017 and 2018, since these behaviors are repeated in time. As a result, a correlation between qualitative and academic information could be established with filed complaints and criminal acts known by the National Police. Likewise, the operational activities of the institution have allowed a holistic observation of crime registered at a national level and a study of criminogenic variables that help having more effective police actions in crime reduction and complementary methods to combat criminal action. © 2019 Policia Nacional de Colombia.

Although the Jewish immigrants to Argentina fit into the modern world from an economic standpoint, in sociocultural terms, they chose the old world. In the absence of an established community setting, they voluntarily established frameworks very similar to those in their cities of origin because only thus did most of them know how to be Jews. While their immigration physically distanced them from Aleppo and Damascus, it did not nullify their connection with their hometowns. The borders of these cities seemed to stretch beyond their geographical location to embrace all Jewish immigrants from the same city in every corner of the world. This article, based on the Halakhic literature from the first half of the twentieth century, examines two aspects of the integration of Jewish immigrants from Syria in Argentina: the Halakhic issues that vexed them from the beginning of their settlement in Argentina and their reliance on rabbis who came from their communities of origin. The Jewish immigrants’ connection with these sages delayed their acclimation for many years and in numerous cases somewhat prevented the blurring of their pre-immigration identity. It also promoted the preservation of the original identity among their second- and third-generation offspring. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG."

It elucidates various key drives of Mexican existentialism from Usigli's moment onward and situates Usigli's literary existentialism within those drives. In so doing, the essay articulates the deeply-rooted ethical bent of a Mexican existentialism forged in the orbit of identity discourse. It argues that Usigli's morally equivocal drama makes unexpected common cause with that bent: dynamically conjugating stagecraft, Mexican philosophy, and post-revolutionary politics, El gesticulador advances a pragmatic authenticity based on altruism, communitarianism, and principles over Truth. © 2019 Revista Canadiense de Estudios Hispanicos.

Provisional restorations must satisfy the requirements of pulpal protection, positional stability, occlusal function, ability to be cleansed, margin accuracy, wear resistance, strength, and esthetics. Although any technique can be used to fabricate a provisional restoration, the choice of technique will be based on the ease, predictability, and availability of materials required to accomplish the required characteristics. This is possible only when an individual has adequate knowledge about the pros and cons of different techniques. Aim: The aim of the study was to assess the awareness among dental students on different techniques available for temporization in the fixed partial denture. Materials and Methods: The survey was conducted based on a questionnaire which was distributed to final-year dental students, interns, and postgraduate students of dental colleges in Chennai. The sample size was 100 students. The survey consisted of 10 questions. The questionnaire elicited awareness of different techniques employed in provisional restoration. The data were extracted and analyzed. Results: About 40% of the respondents answered that CAD CAM-processed temporary restoration has longer shelf life and were better, whereas 20% preferred conventional provisional restorations. Conclusion: The present study concluded that the students were moderately aware of the techniques used in the fabrication of temporary restorations. Further educational and awareness programs need to be undertaken to improve this status. © 2019 JPR Solutions. All rights reserved."

The in vivo stability and tissue inflammatory response to native HUV controls, decellularized HUV (dHUV), and crosslinked decellularized HUV (i.e., GA-dHUV and EC-dHUV) was evaluated after subcutaneous implantation in male albino Wistar rats. Gross and histological analysis upto 3 weeks post implantation (p.i.) at stipulated time intervals showed that native HUVs which served as controls did not induce any reaction. The dHUV and both types of crosslinked HUVs elicited an initial acute inflammatory response. While the tissue response to dHUV subsided within one week the inflammation caused by GA-dHUV and EC-dHUV persisted for more time and subsided by 10th day and 12th day p.i. respectively. Small nodules of fibrous stroma were present at the implantation site in rats with GA-dHUV indicating severe inflammation which was absent in dHUV and EC-dHUV groups. HUVs had degraded by 48 hrs p.i., in all groups. This study revealed that decellularized veins whether crosslinked or uncrosslinked had similar in vivo stability. Uncrosslinked and EC crosslinked acellular veins induced mild to moderate inflammatory response in the host. As EC-dHUV was more biocompatible than GA-dHUV, crosslinking of the vascular conduit scaffold with EC can be considered as safe alternative to GA. © (2019) Society for Biomaterials & Artificial Organs."

The purpose of the paper is to distinguish scientific approaches (interpretations, concepts) to criminal procedural proof and substantiation of the expediency of isolation and use of the author's (complex and systemic) approach. The main approach to the study of this problem was to systematize approaches to criminal procedural proof on the basis of its substantive and functional understanding and to express critical (in both positive and negative terms) opinions on each of them. The paper proposes the identification of four different approaches to understanding the essence of criminal procedural proof: cognitive (wherein two types of interpretation are distinguished: logical (rational) and rational-empirical); active; integrated; complex and systemic.

In dermatology, psoriasis acts as a typical chronic intractable disease, which may be severe, and although biologic agents have been recommended and used for its treatment in recent years, their application is not clear. We administered ghrelin to IMQ-induced psoriasis-like mouse model and examined the anti-inflammatory effect of ghrelin. Methods: In the present study, we induced psoriasiform skin inflammation via the continuous application of imiquimod cream on the backs of BALB/c mice and examined the gross and histopathological effect of the subcutaneous administration of ghrelin on psoriasiform skin inflammation. Results: It was confirmed that the administration of ghrelin improved various scores, including erythema, scales, and epidermal thickening scores, in mice with psoriasiform skin inflammation. Conclusions: The results suggest that ghrelin may be effective in treating psoriasis, including cases involving intractable skin lesions that are resistant to conventional therapies. © 2019 The Authors.

The purpose of the test was to check the fatigue strength of the repaired rotor blade. Metal composite rotor blades have a metal spar in the form of a box and the trailing sections in the form of metallic honeycomb sandwich panels. The trailing sections are bonded to the spar. The repair had been carried out at the point where the trailing section became debonded from the spar at the Air Force Institute of Technology in Warsaw using a methodology developed for carrying out repairs of rotor blades' damage. All types of the Mi family helicopters are equipped with metal composite rotors blades. Depending on MTOW (Maximum Take-Off Weight) and destination of helicopters, blades differ in dimensions, but their design solutions are practically the same. For this reason, the developed repair methodology can be used for all characteristic rotor blades structures for Mi helicopters. The fatigue test was performed at the Łukasiewicz-Institute of Aviation in Warsaw, using a hydraulically driven fatigue machine. The fatigue test was carried out by performing over 1.1 million load cycles. In repair places, upon completion of fatigue testing, no damage was found. © 2019 Michał Sałaciński et al., published by Sciendo 2019."

The usage of tissue conditioner is advantageous as they prepare the preferred oral structures to withstand all the stress from the prosthesis. Although the ease of use in tissue conditioners is evident, the prolonged contact of these dentures may elicit changes in the underlying soft tissues, they may traumatize the oral tissues. Aim: The aim of the survey is to evaluate the knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP) on the usage of tissue conditioners among South Indian dental practitioners. Study and Design: The survey was conducted among South Indian dental practitioners about their KAP in the usage of tissue conditioners among their complete denture patients. A questionnaire survey was formed and sent to 100 dental practitioners all over in South India through online forms. The data collected were subjected to statistical analysis using frequency of responses and standard deviation. Results: The data acquired from this survey have been represented by descriptive analysis and were shown in pie charts. The survey exhibited that the frequency of dentists to use tissue conditioners is 50% followed by rare usage of tissue conditioners. All the practitioners observed side effects such as candida infections, discoloration of the material, and bad odor. More than 80% of the dentists felt that it improves the fit of the denture. About 79.3% of dentists would prefer to sterilize the dentures with 2% chlorhexidine gluconate.

This study aims at forecasting the daily reservoir inflow using the projections of atmospheric variables extracted from the global climatic models as input. Daily rainfall series for the future period is simulated using a calibrated weather generator based on generalized linear models. The simulated daily rainfall series are compared with the monthly predictions obtained from local polynomial regression model, and the best correlated daily rainfall simulation is transformed into stream flow using a calibrated and validated soil and water assessment tool to generate the daily inflow series. The modelling procedure was applied to a typical reservoir catchment in India. Diagnostic checks carried out to assess the performance of the rainfall simulations revealed that the simulated series are having the same statistical characteristics as that of the observed series. The simulated inflow was found to be acceptable with respect to the performance indicators evaluated in the study. The methodology adopted is data driven, flexible and easy to implement. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG."
"Work-related road traffic crash: Is return to work rate after rehabilitation better with outcome-focused intervention?","2019","Malaysian Journal of Medicine and Health Sciences","0","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85089471390&partnerID=40&md5=d9d5fe1ed79c88a1f0cec07cbf7b2c1b","Introduction: Work-related road traffic crashes (RTC) are a significant global public health challenge due to the seriousness of its consequences. Injured workers who have survived work-related RTC are advised to go for rehabilitation after they have been treated physically by healthcare providers. Reintegrate as soon as possible into the working community able avoid long periods of sick leave. Return to work (RTW) rate have been used extensively in many previous studies as an indicator of rehabilitation outcomes on the working capacity of injured workers. The objective of this study was to compare RTW rate after rehabilitation for injured workers who received physical rehabilitation only (control group) and physical rehabilitation plus outcome-focused intervention (intervention group). Methods: Eligible 200 workers who were involved in work-related RTC and agreed to participate in SOCSO RTW Program were identified and invited to be part of this study. Sociodemographic, employment and injury-related questions were distributed. Results: This study finding showed majority (79.5%) of the respondents were aged 25 years old or older, male (86.0%), married or divorced (63.5%), and attained secondary and below education level at secondary or below (66.0%). More than half of injured workers consisted of blue-collar workers (69%), had fracture injury (93.0%), and had injury to their lower limbs (48.5%). RTW rate was higher in the intervention group (received physical rehabilitation and outcome-focused intervention) compared to the control group (received physical rehabilitation only). Conclusion: RTW rate for work-related RTC was higher with outcome-focused intervention, in addition to physical rehabilitation. © 2019 UPM Press. All rights reserved."
"Justice as a fundamental principle of law: A meta-normative context","2019","Journal of Advanced Research in Law and Economics","0","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85088775954&doi=10.14505%2fjarle.v10.7%2845%29.36&partnerID=40&md5=75d200e9123be36b52138dfffff27b7e","In the proposed article, the author at the theoretical level considers the question of the meta-normativity of the justice content as a fundamental principle of law. It is noted that justice is the highest degree of law, whose norms must be set in accordance with its standards, some of which have an ideal, teleological dimension, and therefore their full implementation in a changing social environment cannot be achieved. The moral and regulatory context of justice implies that it is realized in life not in connection with possible coercive measures for violation of its formally defined rules, but for the good will of a person who exercises it freely. As a result of the study, the author concludes that the legal normativity of justice is conditioned by the presence of numerous social contradictions, freedom of individual moral choice and other objective factors that require the establishment of clear and relative criteria for its implementation in public relations. © 2019, by ASERS® Publishing.

After providing a critical assessment of the literature on hegemony in Europe, this article outlines three main trends in the scholarship on German power in European affairs. First, scholars tend to exaggerate Berlin's power capabilities relative to other major European states such as France, Italy, and the United Kingdom. Research shows that Europe is best understood as a multipolar regional order, not a hegemonic system dominated by one powerful state. Second, German leadership in Europe is contested and often delegitimized. Since 1949, German political elites have not been able to exercise influence in Europe without the support of other European states. This remains true even after the collapse of the Franco-German ""tandem"" in the wake of the European debt crisis. Third, scholars fail to adequately address how American power in the North Atlantic impacts regional polarity. Since reunification, the role of the United States in Europe has only increased and American influence over Eastern Europe, in particular, surpasses that of other European powers, including Germany. © Georgetown University and Berghahn Books."
"An in vitro application of mineral trioxide aggregate mixed with calcium hydroxide","2019","Drug Invention Today","0","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85089180751&partnerID=40&md5=ffa37112c725581d48f61775cbc72dd0","Background: Mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) is the most biocompatible material used in endodontics. It is made up of hydrophilic particles that set in the presence of moisture. MTA is used in root-end filling, direct pulp capping, and apexification. The surface hardness of MTA is not very high. To improve the hardness MTA, the possibility of mixing with calcium hydroxide (CH) is explored. Aim: The aim is to estimate the microhardness of MTA when mixed with CH as a root-end filling material. Materials and Methods: Thirty extracted, (n = 30) single-rooted human teeth which includes mandibular single-rooted premolars, maxillary incisors, and canines were selected in the study. The teeth were sectioned horizontally perpendicular to the long axis of the tooth into slices with a thickness of 1.0 mm. The sliced teeth were divided into two groups – one group was filled only with MTA (Group I) and another group was filled with mineral trioxide and CH (Group II). Hardness was measured using Vickers microhardness testing machine and expressed as Vickers pyramid number (HV). Results: Group I showed hardness of 54.7 ± 4.53 (HV) and Group II showed hardness of 55.2 ± 5.07 (HV). Group II showed higher hardness value than Group I, and the mean difference between Groups I and II is statistically significant (P < 0.05). Conclusion: Mixing CH with MTA can improve its properties. In the present study, it is seen that CH improves the hardness of MTA. In future, MTA and CH can be used in vivo studies, and better clinical results can be obtained. © 2019 JPR Solutions.

Many investigations on the collagen to predict its structural and mechanical properties has been done over the decades, but none of them were universally accepted. β-tricalciumphosphate is yet another organic matrix material found in bone for holding and binding the protein fibers and provide its hardness to the flexible frame structure of the proteins. Collagen is well known for its tensile strength and delivers it to its connecting tissue and other parts of the flexible frame structure. In this work, an approach has been made and investigating the impact of collagen protein on the mechanical behavior at its microscopic level and then implemented in the macro structured femur bone. A unit cell prepared in which collagen protein are staggered at the center and surrounded by fibers at the corners. Dimensions of collagen fiber are in the range of 0.01 µm to 0.125 µm at different volume fraction ranging from 10% to 50% of the collagen fibers. Evaluation of Equivalent material properties using Homogenization based Numerical Simulation used for the study of the influence of protein expression level on stress and strain distribution in femur bone by varying the collagen volume level and its diameter. Relationship for mechanical properties of collagen in bone and its geometrical parameters has been predicted in this work. Mechanical properties are decreasing with the increase in the volume fraction of the collagen level while shows increase in it by an increase in the fiber diameter up to particular value and no change with further increase. The effect of collagen fibrils diameter is not as dominant as the change in volume of fraction shows over the stress and strain in the femur bone.

Over the past several decades, a steady downscaling of feature sizes of CMOS technology has been a leading force enabling continual improvement in circuit speeds and cost per functionality. Increase in functionality drives a larger number of I/Os, and the scaling driven small IP block sizes force these larger number of I/Os to be accommodated by a reduction of I/O pitches. The result is an unrelenting pressure to reduce bump pitches from one generation of CMOS to another. In contrast to 14nm/16nm nodes which used 150um bump pitch coming out of a die, for 7nm node the industry is targeting 130um bump pitch for high performance devices. With this pitch reduction, conventional SnAg solder bumps face limitations in terms of bridging. Cu pillar bumps are the best candidate for smaller bump pitches. However, for large die sizes prevalent in High Performance Computing, the Cu pillar bumps will induce higher stress on the silicon resulting in higher risks of ELK cracking. If copper pillar bumps are not properly developed, then there is a risk of marginal reliability in terms of chip package interaction. The situation becomes even more dire in large die sizes, where CTE mismatch between silicon and laminate substrate magnifies the stress. The present paper discusses successful development of Cu pillar bumps for 7nm technology. The development program included a 2-step development path. In the first step, extensive thermo-mechanical modeling was done to find optimal design of copper pillar bump for robustness of interactions with 7nm BEOL ELK layers. In the second step, a 460 mm2 7nm silicon test vehicle was fabricated and its assembly process was optimized to characterize the copper pillar bumps and prove their extended reliability on 7nm silicon. As a result of this development, copper pillar technology has been qualified on AMD products. Today, copper pillar is a fully integral part of AMD's ever-growing 7nm product offering in High Performance Computing. © 2019 Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. All rights reserved."

It is an ideal option for people with good oral health who have lost a tooth or teeth due to injuries, periodontal diseases, and failure of endodontics. It is also used for the treatment of edentulousness and is associated with improved denture retention, stability, and functional efficiency and thus improving the quality of life of the patient. Aim: The aim of this study is to assess the knowledge of dental undergraduate students regarding recent advances in implants. Materials and Methods: A questionnaire will be given to 100 dental students comprising questions to evaluate the knowledge about recent advances in implants. The questionnaire will be administered through the survey planet application and results will be statistically analyzed. Results: About 100% of the respondents were aware of dental implant as a treatment option and that dental implants can be used to support dentures after fabrication, they were also aware that alveolar ridge length and width, inter-arch distance, and placing the right implant based on the indications play a major role in the success of implant. About 81% of the respondents were aware of the absolute contraindications for implant placement and 19% were not aware. Conclusion: From the above survey, we can conclude that dental students have adequate basic knowledge about the implants but lacked knowledge on recent advances in implants. This shows the need of educational intervention to enhance the knowledge through interactive learning aids, seminars, workshops, and including the medical and dental significance of recent advances in implants as a part of the curriculum. © 2019 JPR Solutions.

Grown by plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) technique the LED structure (glass/Cr/p+-nc-Si:H/i-SiNx:H/n+-nc-Si:H/ITO) was then subjected to a high forward voltage stress for one time only, i.e. electroforming process. After electroforming the LED exhibited a boosted visible light emission and memory effect. To study the structural effect of the electroforming on the as-deposited LED the cross-section was extracted by focused ion beam (FIB) technique directly from the electroformed diode and thus prepared for TEM imaging. Since the electroforming process caused crystallization of ITO and its breakup in some parts of the diode surface, the FIB was conducted for the cross-section containing some regions with ITO layer and some without ITO. TEM examination revealed the nanocrystalline phase formation within the intrinsic layer (i-SiNx:H) caused by the electroforming process. The average size and distribution of Si nanocrystallites formed inside i-SiNx:H was determined. The Si nanocrystallization within i-SiNx:H was compared for the regions with and without ITO layer.

The extract was mixed with ethanol and vortexed for maximum dissolution. Luria-Bertani agar plates were inoculated with test organism. The plates were evenly spread out. Then, wells were prepared in the plates with a cork borer. Each well was loaded with 50 µl. The plates were incubated for 24 h at 37°C. The development of the inhibition zone around the well was measured (diameter) and recorded. Tetracycline was used as a positive control. Results: In this in vitro study, we assessed the antimicrobial efficacy of sliver nanoparticles with Calotropis gingantea extract and tetracycline against E. faecalis. The antimicrobial activity of nanosilver particles with C. gingantea extract was moderate compared to that of conventional tetracycline. Tetracycline rapidly killed the bacteria in the Petri dish, only partial disinfection can be achieved in the surface wall of the root canal and tetracycline was relatively effective. More the concentration of the sample, more is the antibacterial effect of the sample. Conclusion: Silver nanoparticles incorporated into the extract C. gingantea against E. faecalis are less effective than tetracycline. Therefore, increasing concentration of the extract C. gingantea in nanoparticles can be assessed in the future. © 2019 JPR Solutions. All rights reserved."

Maximum reaction force occurred was just before the adhesive was removed. The shear stress of the specimen exhibited the same characteristics and an equivalent stress. Thus, the data of this study resulting in the fracture characteristics of the structural adhesives for each shape can be applied to the design with durability. © The Korean Society for Precision Engineering This is an Open-Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0) which permits unrestricted non-commercial use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited."
"Contraceptive methods among young married women in rural Burkina Faso: Challenges and motivations","2019","South African Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology","0","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85088678941&doi=10.7196%2fSAJOG.2019.v25i3.1459&partnerID=40&md5=36a305c510f9aa750a8e75286a0b9d86","Background. Contraceptive prevalence remains low in developing countries. This low prevalence is not linked to unmet family planning needs, but rather to barriers to contraceptive use in women. One of the benefits of contraception is birth spacing and better development for the family. In Burkina Faso, few studies have been performed on the barriers and motivations to the use of contraception by young rural married women. Objectives. We conducted a qualitative, descriptive, exploratory case study to understand the barriers and motivations to the use of effective modern methods of contraception by young married women in rural Burkina Faso. Methods. Modern contraceptive methods were hormonal (oral or injectble) or intra-uterine devices. The sampling was non-probabilistic by reasoned choices. Data were derived from responses from individual in-depth semi-structured interviews, observations and a literature review. These were then analysed thematically. Results. Gender relations unfavorable to women, the desire to have a large family, and shortcomings in communication constitute obstacles to the use of modern contraceptive methods. Despite these obstacles, the many benefits of modern contraceptives, namely the improving of health and family welfare and the empowerment of young women are a motivation to the use of effective contraception by young women, though this is dependant on partner support. Conclusion. Despite the many obstacles to contraception, the many benefits motivate women to adhere to contraceptive methods. © 2019, South African Medical Association. All rights reserved."

Then, sequential fetching of the stored data provides basic optimum firing triggers TRA, TRB and TRC for driving the inverter switching elements. Main contribution of the paper is controlling the inverter output frequency online through adjusting the fetching period. Moreover, the presented approach characterizes by simplicity, cost effective and activity in achieving the space vector technique. Validity of the proposed method was practically examined through a hardware built workbench, which based on the microcontroller ATMEGA 2560.

In the focus are origin myths of the Incas and archaeological data. Manco Capak who supposedly ruled the Inca at the time of their arrival at the Cuzco Valley, became the first half-legendary ruler of the country and started the official Inca dynasty. Two versions of origin myth end with the account of building Cuzco city by Manco in the name of Viracocha the Creator and Inti the sun god. The founding of city in the name of two gods could be interpreted in a manner uniquely provident and theocratic for the history of the Andean state Tahuantinsuyu: Viracocha had provided that Manco's tribe will rule the world, and Manco started to carry it out at the will and guidance of god Inti. Thus, the civilisational mission of the Inca found a theological explanation as well. The ethnocentric and imperialist origin myth formed the ideological foundation for establishing so-called early totalitarian state. Ancient Peruvian myths can also be effectively seen in the context of genealogical interpretation of the imperial dynasty of Incas.  © 2019 by the authors."

This study aims to explore job satisfaction and its risk factors among workers working in a noisy workplace. Method: The study design was cross-sectional study which involved 167 workers in a cable manufacturing factory selected by simple random sampling. MSQ was used to assess employee's satisfaction with their job on seven facets and sound level meter was used to measure workplace noise level. Results: All respondents were exposed to noise above permissible exposure limit. Most workers (49%) were moderately satisfied with their work. Factors that were rated as lowest level of satisfaction were work itself (the ability to work alone) (40%) and the way company system policies are implemented (40%). Factors with the highest level of satisfaction were their freedom to implement their judgement (responsibility) (51%) and the supervision quality of their superiors (51%). The most dominant facet predicting total satisfaction level was recognition followed by advancement and company policy and administration. All variables in socio-demographical and job characteristics were not significantly associated with their level of job satisfaction except noise. Noise was significant in predicting one facet of job satisfaction which was physical work condition. Conclusion: Overall, the average level of job satisfaction among respondents were moderate and they were exposed to occupational noise which was the only significant study variable correlated with their job satisfaction. © 2019 UPM Press.

FB fading model is a novel generalized fading model that unifies various fading models such as Rayleigh, Nakagami, one-sided Gaussian, Rician, Rician shadowed, κ-μ, κ-μ shadowed, η-μ and Beckmann. The considered D2D system is assumed to be affected by various FB faded co-channel interferers. Using the characteristic function (CF) approach outage probability and success probability expressions are given. These expressions are functions of D2D and interference path-loss exponents, distance between the D2D devices, distances between interferers and the D2D receiver and, interference and D2D fading channel conditions. Maximum ratio combining (MRC) and selection combining (SC) based diversity schemes are considered to mitigate channel fading effects.

Materials and Methods: A retrospective cohort study of infertile patients who underwent ultrasonography-guided HTC in a tertiary hospital, between 2010 and 2016. All patients included were diagnosed with unilateral/bilateral PTO on hysterosalpingograpy (HSG). HTC was performed using a modified Novy cornual cannulation set which was inserted through a 5F working cannel during an office operative hysteroscopy, followed by fallopian tube irrigation with saline-air mixture under ultrasonographic imaging. Patients who did not conceive in the following 6-12 months were referred to IVF treatment. Results: Sixty-one patients were included. Tubal recanalization rate was achieved in 25/25 of unilaterally occluded tubes (100%), and in 63/72 of bilaterally occluded tubes (87.5%). Median duration of follow up after catheterization was 40.57 months. In a median of 3.5 months following the procedure, 16 (26.2%) patients conceived spontaneously (n=14) or following intrauterine insemination (n=2), 12 (19.6%) of them delivered. Twenty-two additional patients underwent IVF after a median of 11 months following HTC. Sixteen of them conceived following a median of two cycles, of whom 75% failed IVF treatment prior to HTC.

The use of the mathematical apparatus of fuzzy set theory and the use of a linguistic variable makes it possible to form a comprehensive quality index based on incomplete and inaccurate information obtained by expert means. Such an indicator may be the ‘attractiveness of the route’. An expert system is presented in which the quality assessment of the route is made according to the formal rules of fuzzy logic. A mathematical model of transport service quality management was constructed to select the driving route according to the criterion of ‘route attractiveness’, which was compiled according to the rules of Mamdani's inference. Compatibility functions for Ukrainian sections of international transport corridors (ITCs) have been obtained, and schedules of attractiveness of the route according to the investigated ITCs have been constructed. The Hamming distance metric and the Bellman-Zadeh approach were used to test the convergence of the study results.

In this study, we studied weight reduction using lightweight materials such as aluminum alloys to increase fuel economy. For this purpose, we propose a lightweight design process of the shock tower mounting bracket, which is the largest loaded part among the vehicle parts. The change in strength and dynamic strength was investigated by replacing the existing cast iron material with 320 MPa of aluminum A356 casting material. For strength and dynamic stiffness analysis of the shock tower mounting bracket, the load on the peripheral members was calculated. As a result of the dynamic stiffness analysis, we identified the weak part and calculated that the lifetime of the shock tower mounting bracket is safe for the calculated load conditions. Through this study, we provide a guide for lightweight design and suggest optimal design conditions for development of a vehicle shock tower mounting bracket. © The Korean Society for Precision Engineering This is an Open-Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0) which permits unrestricted non-commercial use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited."

This study aims to estimate health risks associated with chemical exposures to nicotine, propylene glycol (PG) and selected Tobacco- Specific Nitrosamines (TSNAs) namely 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK) and N'-nitrosonornicotine (NNN) in e-liquids locally-manufactured in Malaysia. Methods: The health risk assessment (HRA) was performed using established guideline by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The average daily dose (ADD) and lifetime average daily dose (LADD) were calculated using previously published data on chemical concentration of selected compounds and local EC usage topography data. Next, the non-carcinogenic risk (nicotine and PG) and carcinogenic risk (NNK and NNN) were calculated and denoted as total hazard quotient (HQT) and total lifetime cancer risk (LCRT) value, respectively. Results: For non-carcinogenic risk, the mean of HQTwas 78.9 which falls under ""unacceptable"" risk as demonstrated by HQTvalue of more than 1.

Conclusion: Comprehensive HRA using currently available data of local EC usage topography and chemical evaluation of Malaysian-made e-liquids have revealed that the exposure to nicotine, PG and selected TSNAs are expected to be a significant health concern for local EC users. This finding supports the local health authority to issue a stringent health policy in considering EC as a tool for smoking cessation among heavy smokers. © 2019 UPM Press. All rights reserved."
"To assess the competency level in diagnosis of maxillary fractures among dental college students","2019","Drug Invention Today","0","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85089198792&partnerID=40&md5=b1d3db2aa0e90f148e34cfa5092f6f37","Aim: This study aims to analyze the competency level in diagnosis of maxillary fractures among dental college students. Background: Maxillary fractures are the second most common midfacial fractures, first being the zygomatic fractures. Some of the common causes of maxillary fractures are road traffic accidents (RTAs), assault, and other causes. Usually, the best way to diagnose or identify fractures is by analyzing radiographs. Radiographs can be of two types – intraoral and extraoral radiographs. Maxillary or midfacial fractures are analyzed using extraoral radiographs which include the following: Occipitomental view, submentovertex view, lateral cephalogram, Water’s view, and cone-beam computerized tomography. Maxillary fractures are not common when compared to mandibular fractures. This could be due to the anatomy of maxilla. However, it is most important to read about maxillary fractures due to the increasing RTA. Methodology: This is a cross-sectional study that was conducted at Saveetha Medical College and Hospitals, Tamil Nadu, India. Dental college students of all years starting from the 1st year to interns were included in the study, whereas those students who were unwilling to participate in the study were excluded from the study. A self-administered questionnaire consisting of 1 essay type and 11 multiple-choice questions in English was developed and handed over to the students. The participants were instructed not to discuss the questions or answers among themselves or others. Results: From the collected data, it was found that most of the dental students irrespective of the year had inadequate knowledge of maxillary fractures and the tools used for its diagnosis. Conclusion: From the above study, it can be concluded that the knowledge regarding the diagnosis of maxillary fractures among dental students is poor. Although majority of them have adequate knowledge regarding the clinical features of maxillary fractures, radiographic knowledge and confidence level in diagnosing the same seem low and inadequate. Hence, it is important for the dental curriculum to focus more on the radiographs and diagnosis part of maxillary fractures as their frequency rate is increasing with the increase in RTAs. © 2019 JPR Solutions.

Instructors of large classes may have only option to deliver lecture to convey information to large group of students. Various methodologies have been employed including lecture, PowerPoint presentation, and interactive sessions. The receptivity of students varies in different lecture sessions. This study was carried out to analyze interaction of students in a lecture class through a questionnaire-based study and also to improve the effect of teaching in various methods. Aim: The aim of this study was to assess the receptivity of dental students in a lecture class through a questionnaire. Materials and Methods: A questionnaire consisting of 20 questions was prepared to attain information regarding the receptivity of students in a lecture hall. This study was conducted among a sample of 115 students who were doing 1st and 2nd years in the Saveetha Dental College and Hospital. The data collected were analyzed. Results: Thirty-three agreed that communicating well with the lecturers helped them to improve their learning. Of 57 2nd year students, 42 agreed to this. Twenty-eight of the 1st year students answered that the team-based learning helped them to retain the learned things easily. Thirty-six of the 1st year students agreed listening to the lecture keenly helped to improve their performance. Most of them preferred the online quizzes and pointed out that visual and auditory materials help in recollecting the lectures. Conclusion: Blended learning with different teaching methods into dental education appears to be an important development and provided courses if appropriately designed, they can be instrumental in encouraging effective learning. © 2019 JPR Solutions.

I argue that the German economy appears strong because of its recent positive performance in two politically salient areas: unemployment and the current account. A deeper assessment reveals, however, that German economic performance cannot be considered a second economic miracle, but is at best a mini miracle. The reduction in unemployment is an important achievement. That said, it was not the product of faster growth, but of sharing the same volume of work among more individuals. Germany's current account surpluses are as much the result of weak domestic demand as of export prowess. Germany has also logged middling performances in recent years regarding growth, investment, productivity, and compensation. The article also reviews seven challenges Germany has faced since unification: financial transfers from west to east, the global financial crisis, the euro crisis, internal and external migration, demographics, climate change, and upheavals in the automobile industry. German policy-makers managed the first four challenges largely successfully. The latter three will be more difficult to tackle in the future. © Georgetown University and Berghahn Books."

Obstetric hemorrhage is the third most common cause of maternal death in South Africa. Abruptio placentae (AP) contributed to 12.9% of deaths caused by haemorrhage between 2017 and 2018. Objective. To investigate the risk factors, management and outcomes of pregnancies affected by AP. Methods. We conducted a prospective descriptive study in a one-year period at the Pretoria Academic Complex (PAC). All patients who presented with AP were recruited for the study. The demographics, risk factors, management, complications and outcomes were reported using descriptive statistics. Results. One hundred women with AP presented during the study period, representing an incidence of 1% of pregnancies at PAC. Sixty-one percent of the women had caesarean delivery while 37% had vaginal delivery. A minority of women presented with known risk factors of AP in this setting. Two comparison groups were defined based on the degree of placental separation from the decidua, i.e. >50% and <50%. A woody hard abdomen occurred more frequently in patients with >50% AP (43% v. 57%; p=0.002). More women had postpartum haemorrhage in the >50% group (67% v. 33%; p=0.001). Fifty-eight (58%) live babies and 44 (44%) stillborn babies were delivered. Conclusion. The known risk factors of AP were largely absent in women with AP in this setting. The typical clinical findings of AP were late signs associated with severe placental separation. Early resuscitation and delivery of the fetus can positively influence perinatal and maternal morbidity and mortality. © 2019, South African Medical Association. All rights reserved."

Such motion is divided into two states in this paper: pivot turning and coupled turning between angular velocity and linear velocity. In the processing of pivot turning, the slippage parameters could be obtained by measuring the end point in a square path. In the process of coupled turning, the slippage parameters could be calculated by measuring the perimeter of a circular path and the linear distance between the start and end points. The identification results showed that slippage parameters were affected by velocity. Therefore, a fuzzy rule base was established with the basis on the identification data, and a fuzzy controller was applied to motion control and dead reckoning. This method effectively compensated for errors resulting in unequal tension between the left and right tracks, structural dimensions and slippage. The results demonstrated that the accuracy of robot positioning and control could be substantially improved on a rigid floor. © 2019 Editorial Department of Journal of Beijing Institute of Technology."

The issue appeared in the Autumn of 2008. In this sense it is a snapshot of Haskell at a particular moment of his rich and on-going career. My particular intention was to trace the ways in which Haskell's aesthetic and moral orientations as both a poet and a critic stem from his formative experiences, including family background, class, education, reading and the place in which he grew up. Beneath his honest and acute responses one can trace not only the lineaments of Australia's “poetry wars” but also the impacts of those real wars (WW II, Vietnam and Iraq) on his imaginative life and stance as a poet. Haskell is not a predictable subject to interview. For instance, his statement that “it is important to write about domestic spaces” would perhaps sit at odds with a male poet of his generation. Looking back down the years to this interview with a valued teacher and trojan worker for literature in many countries and many contexts, I would argue that it is Haskell's iconoclastic character that has kept his practice sharp, surprising and “on song.” The question posed by the poem “Doubt and Trembling” that I discussed with him - “How do we get by/ in a dubious time” - seems in 2019 more relevant than ever. © 2019 International Islamic University Malaysia.

Our aim was to examine his neuroanatomical drawings in the context of the era in which they were produced and their influence on future scholars. Emphasis is placed on analysing the artistic techniques employed and Bell's unique manner of conveying both structure and function. The images discussed include those featured in his book entitled The Anatomy of the Brain: Explained in a Series of Engravings. These images can be viewed in parallel with his writing on the anatomy of the brain, in which he describes the usual manner of demonstrating neuroanatomy as 'dull' and 'unmeaning'. His mastery of artistic technique complements his insightful descriptions of this prodigiously complex organ. The result is a more engaging account of neuroanatomy and an impressive display of his skill as an artist, anatomist and physician. Examining these expressive portrait-like diagrams provides greater insight into the mind of the pioneer of modern neuroscience."

Penoxsulam has been shown to have adverse effects on plant growth; hence, it prevents plants from producing an important enzyme, acetolactate synthase. Glutathione-s-transferase (GST) plays a vital role in the detoxification of xenobiotics including Herbicides. Geneticallyengineered algae can provide feasible and environmentally safe approaches for the phycoremediation of herbicides. In the current study, Cyanobacterial GST was transferred to Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, a model unicellular alga, via the Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation method. The GST enzyme activity was confirmed in three transgenic C. reinhardtii lines. To evaluate the removal capacity of penoxsulam by transgenic C. reinhardtii, the microalgae were treated with penoxsulam at 5, 10, and 20 μg ml-1 for twenty-four hours. The percentage of the herbicide removal from 5 and 20 μg ml-1 reached maximally 93.6 % and 54 % in the case of transgenic alga, whereas in the case of the wild type, the percentage of removal reached 52 % and 21 %, respectively. Langmuir and Freundlich adsorption isotherm models and the sorption kinetics have been applied to the experimental data to check the effectiveness of the removal process. The equilibrium data were well-fitted with the Langmuir isotherm model. The results showed that GST transgenic microalgae are effective in the removal of penoxsulam from aqueous solutions and it can be used in phycoremediation systems of herbicides. © Hashemite University."

Meant both as a partial continuation and as a reaction against its monolithic predecessor, digimodernism brought to light Lyotardâs ambivalent legacy of the grand narratives and sought to demonstrate their actuality, despite the few muffled screams of irony and ambiguity, found at the dying heart of postmodernity. Alternatively, the postmodern is seen as a space where capitalism does not necessarily suppress the possibility of emancipation, by means of the Web 2.0-based technology and where it does not always amount to efficiency and profit. By looking at Stephanie Sarleyâs art, I will attempt not only to conceptualize and illustrate industrial pornography as a metanarrative, with regard to the type of food porn the artist creates, but also to elaborate on the uninterrupted connection between digimodern and postmodern features reflected in her prototypic art and exemplify how the former comes to be inscribed as a technological facet of the latter. The endless narrative form sheds light on a process of alienation from the basic goal of the prescribed mechanisms found at the core of the pornographic industry and labels the metanarrative of FOOD PORN AT THE CROSSROADS 111 Judeo-Christianity as oppressive, against freedom and democracy, while the metanarrative of capitalism is almost reduced to non-existence through Sarleyâs altogether purely emancipatory, digimodern and postmodern artwork. © 2019 Babes-Bolyai University of Cluj, Faculty of Letters.

In this paper, the size and distribution of the cyclotetramethylenete tranitramine(HMX) fragments were analyzed by the Laser Particle Size Analyzer Malvern MS2000. The post-analysis results of fragments showed that size distribution of fragments was strongly dependent on drop height. An empirical formula is established to describe the relationship between the average size and drop height. The volume-based probability distribution of explosive fragments was also studied by experiments and theoretical calculations. © 2019 Editorial Department of Journal of Beijing Institute of Technology."

First, integrated navigation system theory and system error sources are introduced in details. Secondly, a navigation system's observation equation on the original scale is decomposed into different scales by the discrete wavelet transform method, and noise reduction is performed by setting the wavelet de-noising threshold. At last, the dynamic equation and observation equations are fused on different scales by the wavelet transformation and Kalman filter. The results show that the proposed algorithm has smaller navigation error and higher navigation accuracy. © 2019 Editorial Department of Journal of Beijing Institute of Technology."

Job satisfaction comprises the degree of an individual’s feelings towards and satisfaction with present job activities, the accomplishment and responsibilities as well as the degree of an individual’s satisfaction with all aspects that directly or indirectly related to the present job and job content. Hence job satisfaction is the consequence where as job engagement is the antecedents. Fully engaged doctors are more satisfied and will more likely to remain with the hospitals .Keeping in view the above, a thorough understanding of the factors associated with job engagement is much needed where job satisfaction will be playing a major role. Job switching and doctors turnover are becoming recent experience since the young generation doctors enter the corporate hospitals. The study explores the level of job satisfaction and also tries to find the relationship between the individual and job satisfaction related factors on the job satisfaction of young generation doctors working in corporate hospitals.

Multi-tiered instructional models can be used to appropriately identify and support students who need intensive intervention while minimizing over-identification of students. The purpose of this increasing intensity study was to explore the clinical applicability of a tiered narrative language intervention for kindergarten students at-risk for academic difficulties. Methods: Eleven kindergarten students who speak African American English (AAE) participated in a large group co-taught narrative language instruction. An increasing intensity design was used to identify treatment responders and treatment minimal responders. Minimal responders were provided individualized intervention. Results: Eight students were characterized as responders to the large group instruction because of their increased narrative retell performance. Three students were minimal responders to the large group instruction and resultantly received a brief individualized intervention. Throughout the study, students improved their narrative language performance measured by story grammar, story episodes, and language complexity. Conclusions: The feasibility of this collaborative narrative intervention with increasing intensity based on student response coupled with recent tiered narrative experimental studies is promising.

Many individuals contribute information each day. The growing amount of geodata is gathered by volunteers or obtained via crowd-sourcing. One outstanding example of this is the OpenStreetMap (OSM) Project which provides access to big data in geography. Another online mapping service that enables the integration of geodata into the analysis is Google Maps. The expanding content and the availability of geographic information radically changes the perspective on geodata (Chilton 2009). Recently many application programming interfaces (APIs) have been built on OSM and Google Maps. That leads to a point where it is possible to access sections of geographical information without the usage of a complex database solution, especially if one only requires a small data section for a visualization. First tools for spatial analysis have been included in the R language very early (Bivand and Gebhardt, 2000) and this development will continue to accelerate, underpinning a continual change. Notably, in recent years many tools have been developed to enable the usage of R as a geographic information system (GIS). With a GIS it is possible to process spatial data. QuantumGIS (QGIS) is a free software solution for these tasks, and a user interface is available for this purpose. R is, therefore, an alternative to geographic information systems like QGIS (QGIS Development Team 2009). Besides, add-ins for QGIS and R-packages (RQGIS) are available, that enables the combination of R and QGIS (Muenchow and Schratz 2017). It is the target of this article to present some of the most important R-functionalities to download and process geodata from OSM and the Google Maps API. The focus of this paper is on functions that enable the natural usage of these APIs. © 2020, Technische Universitaet Wien."

The alternative to such misery is the Consilience project, a city created to offer jobs and all the basic comforts (now considered luxuries) to all its inhabitants. The success of the system relies on the local prison, Positron, where all the citizens must present themselves once every two months, swapping their lives with those of other prisoners. The aim of my paper is to analyze Atwoodâs novel using the Foucauldian concepts of ""panopticism"" and ""discipline society"" expanded upon in Discipline and Punish, the Birth of the Prison (1976). These concepts describe two features of the fictional society created by Atwood: The awareness that one is being constantly spied on by an unidentified entity that creates a discipline society, and hence a city where order and equality reign, a utopia based on control and surveillance. The paper will also explore Atwoodâs concept of ""ustopia"" and how it applies to Consilience. © 2019 Babes-Bolyai University of Cluj, Faculty of Letters. All right reserved."

The numerical simulation of metal powder compaction based on the finite element method (FEM) provides a better and efficient approach for the researchers of this process and its complicated mechanical behaviors. Numerical simulation of powder compaction plays an important role in the Intelligent Manufacturing Technology (IMT) and computer Integrated Manufacturing systems (CIMS).With the help of FEM, intricate mechanical models can be introduced and powder compaction parameters can be determined. In this work we are making an assumption that the metal powder is a kind of compressible continuous material. We were analyzed with the help of two types of yield criterion one is ellipsoidal and the other one is the elasto-plastic constitutive relationship. By taking into account of geometrical nonlinearity condition such as large displacement and large strain, constitutive relationship based on the updated Lagrange (UL) formulation was derived. Here, we are using ABAQUS to simulate the compaction process of the cylindrical sample were performed. The compact force and distribution of the relative density of this sample were analyzed. Numerical simulation of powder compaction provides optimization of the tools, processes and its control schemes as well as for the IMT and the development of the devices. © 2019 International Journal of Mechanical Engineering.

Obtaining accurate ICP is a crucial first step for taking an appropriate treatment. Current methods available for monitoring ICP can be grouped into invasive and non-invasive. Both of them have their pros and cons. Invasive methods are reliable for determining absolute ICP, but they may cause infection; a well-trained surgeon is required to install and to calibrate the pressure sensor. Non-invasive methods do not have the above shortcomings, but they are not reliable for measuring absolute ICP. The proposed method is both non-invasive and able to measure absolute ICP. In the method, correlation between ICP changes and external vibration responses of the head of a specific patient is established by a series of patient-specific finite element simulations. A vibration response measured from the patient’s head is then used to determine the patient’s ICP with the established correlation. The new method will be able to reduce diagnosis time, improve diagnosis accuracy and alleviate patients’ suffering. © 2019 International Journal of Mechanical Engineering. All rights reserved."

Unlike Claudio Guillén, who claims that exiled writers can triumph over their native attachments and create a literature of ""counter-exile,"" I propose, alongside critics like Lamming, Rushdie, or Said, that the trauma of displacement can never be entirely left behind and is constantly part of exilic writing. In addition, I make the claim that paraexilic literature is a peculiar form of internalizing exile by means of irony and contradiction. I am illustrating this attitude with the work of Constantin Noica, one of the most popular and respected philosophers in post-war Romania, who rejected emigration and, instead, adopted the paradoxical solution of triumphing over internal and internalized exile by embracing it as a form of liberation. I am proposing the rhetorical category of contra-discourse-a dialogic structure of argument and narrative in which the homely and the foreign are spoken of in the ironically mingled voices of the oppressor and of the victim. I am concluding with the suggestion that, while the work of Noica is in many ways idiosyncratic, it may also be viewed as a typical form of coping with exilic traumas in Central and East European cultures during communism. © 2019 Babes-Bolyai University of Cluj, Faculty of Letters.

Ovarian actinomycosis with no history of IUD is very rare. Case Report: A 61-year-old female presented with ovarian actinomycosis mimicking ovarian malignant tumor. The present was a very rare case of ovarian actinomycosis with no history of IUD. The patient presented with abdominal pain and mild fever for a half year. On examination, bilateral ovarian tumors suspecting ovarian malignant tumor were detected. At the operation, the authors diagnosed the patient as bilateral ovarian abscess and performed a bilateral ovarian cystectomy. The pathological examination of bilateral ovary showed ovarian abscess, and immunohistochemistry of bilateral ovary showed ovarian actinomycosis. The diagnosis was established postoperatively. Conclusion: Although diagnosis of ovarian actinomycosis is very difficult, especially in patients with no history of IUD, ovarian actinomycosis should be considered in case of suspecting ovarian malignant tumor with abdominal pain and fever persisting for a long interval. © 2019 S.O.G.

VVP cases have been usually mistaken for condyloma acuminatum leading to administration of incorrect and unnecessary treatments. HPV has been shown not to be an etiological factor in the literature. In this study, the authors presented patients who underwent biopsies due to various vulvar conditions. They aimed to determine the rate of patients who had VVP. Materials and Methods: A total of 209 female patients, between the ages of 20-45 years, were evaluated in this retrospective study. They presented to thus hospital between 2008 and 2018 due to various vulvar conditions and from whom biopsies were taken from vulvas for accurate diagnosis. Results: As a result of microscopic assessment of 209 cases, 76 cases were grouped under fibro-epithelial polyp (FEP), 46 cases under condyloma acuminatum, and 16 cases under VVP. The mean age of the patients was 28 ± 5 years. The authors reviewed 209 cases pathologically and identified VVP in 7.6% of them. Conclusion: VVP is a frequently seen condition and misdiagnosis and mistreatment is quite common in gynecological practice. A correct diagnosis is very important to avoid unnecessary treatments. The need for its treatment generally arises due to the irritating symptoms it causes in the vulva. © 2019 S.O.G. CANADA Inc.. All rights reserved."

We obtain some queueing models available in the literature as special cases of our model by taking suitable values of the parameters. We also derive various performance measures, waiting-time distributions in the queue and demonstrate the impact of various system parameters through numerical results. A major challenge for the content providers in multimedia application systems is to handle impatient users, who might abandon the system owing to delay. One may apply this model on a video on demand system that serves requests in a batch while giving due consideration to balking and reneging phenomena that arise from customer impatience. © ISOSS Publications 2019."

The aim of our research was to assess the teenagers’ awareness of the law, and the changes occurred in their attitude and smoking behaviour between 2014 and 2016. Our cross-sectional study used self-administered questionnaires, completed by 7th grade students. The randomly stratified sample involved students from 21 localities, 21 schools, 55 classes from three Transylvanian counties. The results showed that those who were considered to be tobacco consumers smoked significantly less cigarettes after the implementation of the new law than before (an average of 3.51 sticks to 5.72 sticks, p<0,001). Compared to 2014, in 2016 the smoking trends have changed, the usage of classical tobacco became less frequent, the electronic cigarette, the hookah, the homemade cigarette and cigar or the pipe have gained more popularity. The perception of the new law is positive, still highly influenced by smoking habits, since non-smokers have a more favourable attitude in this direction than the tobacco consumers. © 2019, Romanian Academic Society.

The linearly separable features of Relu3-1, Relu4-1 and Relu5-4 layers from VGG-Net-19 are especially suitable for target tracking. Then, correlation filters over hierarchical convolutional features are learned to generate their correlation response maps. Finally, a novel approach of weight adjustment is presented to fuse response maps. The maximum value of the final response map is just the location of the target.

Materials and Methods: The authors examined the LMR as a prognostic variable in a cohort of 66 patients with uterine sarcoma who underwent surgical resection. Patients were categorized into two groups based on the LMR using cut-off values determined by receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis. They assessed the effect of the LMR on progression-free survival (PFS) and validated the LMR as independent predictor of survival. Results: Using data from the whole cohort, the optimized LMR cut-off value selected using the ROC curve was 5.86 for PFS. The LMR-low and LMR-high groups included 45 (68.2%) and 21 (31.8%) patients, respectively. The five-year PFS rates in the LMR-low and LMR-high groups were 69.0% and 94.4%, respectively (p = 0.024). Via multivariate analysis, the authors identified FIGO stage, residual tumor after surgery, and LMR as the most valuable prognostic factors affecting PFS (p = 0.039, p = 0.018, and p = 0.043, respectively).

Bone tissue bank is a link between the donor and the recipient by which the donation becomes a medium of health improvement for both the donor and the recipient. At the Department of Orthopedics, Mostar University Clinical Hospital, about 200 total hip replacements are performed per year. Most patients undergoing total hip replacement surgery (90%) have been diagnosed with osteoarthritis, and they are suitable donors, having in mind their age and comorbidities. In the same Department, around 50 procedures that require bone transplants are performed per year. A team of highly competent surgeons are working on an intensive process of adaptation oriented to quality improvement and intensification of the activity, both with the goal of meeting the standards of excellence in orthopedic surgery. The presence of a bone tissue bank has a favorable impact on the quality of health care owing to bone transplant availability, as well as on the scientific role of a highly specialized institution that examines the properties of bone tissue."

It increases the risk of death and thromboembolic events. Vitamin K antagonists reduce these risks. Disadvantages of vitamin K antagonist therapy are narrow therapeutic range and interactions with drugs and food. In a single center prospective study, we enrolled 249 patients with atrial fibrillation over a 12-month period. The aim of our study was to evaluate vitamin K antagonist use regarding the indication and adequate dose. Data on 249 consecutive patients with atrial fibrillation were collected before general availability of novel oral anticoagulants. Out of 249 patients, 160 (64.2%) had indication for oral anticoagulant therapy. Only 81 (50.6%) patients had vitamin K antagonist in therapy, 12 (14.8%) of them in adequate dose. We also analyzed 129 patients aged over 75, of which 109 (84.4%) had absolute indication for oral anticoagulant therapy. Only 34 (31.2%) patients aged over 75 had been receiving vitamin K antagonist therapy and 6 (17.6%) had the International Normalized Ratio values within the proposed therapeutic interval. We found a significantly higher rate of anticoagulant therapy introduction in patients under 75 years (p=0.03), but there were no significant differences in the adequacy of anticoagulant therapy (p=0.89) between these two populations. Our results showed clear inadequacies of vitamin K antagonist treatment with a growing need for a wider use of novel oral anticoagulants."

The UPR reviews the human rights of all UN Member States every four years. During the review, each state receives a number of recommendations from other UN member states. This paper uses data from UPR Info to determine if states with better human rights performance as measured by the CIRI human rights data project receive fewer recommendations than states with worse performance. It finds that, even when controlling for other factors, states with worse records on civil and political rights generally receive more recommendations than states with better records. States with lower scores from CIRI on women's economic and political rights receive more recommendations regarding women's issues than states with higher scores. These findings hold regardless of region, suggesting that, at a minimum, the UPR process is identifying violators of human rights. © 2020, Center for Foreign Policy and Peace Research, Ihsan Dogramaci Peace Foundation."

This paper examines the factors shaping European Union democracy aid allocation decisions from 1990-2010, weighing the relative impact of ideational concerns (regime type, human rights) and self-interests (political, security, economic). We argue that EU democracy aid reflects a ""democracysecurity dilemma"" as the EU balances ideational reasons for promoting democracy with concerns over political and economic relationships, regional stability, and security. We test our hypotheses with a series of random effects, generalized least squares and Heckman selection models, which provide support for our argument.

This existential upheaval can be accompanied by spiritual ""work"" which contributes to the adjustment to the disease and to the conditions of the end of life. Spirituality can be defined as a process through which individuals seek for and give meaning to their life, feel connected to the self, to others, at the present moment and in what is sacred. Few studies in France have studied spirituality in the context of cancer. So, the aim of our research was to identify and to study the role of spiritual components in the experience of cancer. Procedure: We carried out 15 semi-directed interviews with patients at the medical oncology and palliative care department at the CHU in Timone (Marseille). A double analysis was performed: 1) a lexicographical analysis and 2) a thematic content analysis of the most typical interviews from the lexicographical analysis. Results: The lexicographical analysis highlighted three lexical classes. Class 1 represented the illness of cancer as a personal transformation (40.5%), Class 2 concerned the biographical disruption experience (13.4%) and Class 3 corresponded to daily life with the illness (46.1%). Moreover, the thematic content analysis revealed different themes testifying to spirituality in the lived experience of cancer, in particular the experience of and the relationship with the sacred, the relationship with transcendence and the role of spirituality in the lived experience of patients who are suffering from cancer. Conclusion: The two analyses of the interviews allowed us to identify the expression of spirituality. Spirituality was expressed as a resource, an ""invisible spring,"" allowing people to adjust to the extreme experience of the disease of cancer. Both ""secular"" and ""central"" dimensions of spirituality: the transcendence and the relationship with the sacred open perspectives for the integration of spirituality into the care of patients suffering from cancer, without threatening the principle of secularism in French hospitals. © Lavoisier SAS 2019."

Core body temperature was measured with a nasopharyngeal temperature probe at the induction of anaesthesia and at the end of the procedure. Other recorded variables were type of warming blanket, ambient theatre temperature and duration of surgery. It was noted whether the patient was shivering immediately post-operatively. The following demographic details were recorded: age, sex, body mass index and the American Society of Anaesthesiologists physical status score. The statistical analysis was performed with Stata® 12 (StataCorp LP, College Station, Texas) by use of a conditional regression model to calculate associations between post-operative body temperature and other variables. The series included 30 female and 16 male patients aged 18 to 57 years (mean 35), with a mean BMI of 26.4 (standard deviation 4.2). Overall incidence of hypothermia below 36°C was 61%. Results of the conditional regression analysis suggested a positive association between post-operative body temperature and pre-operative body temperature (P<.001). Incidence of hypothermia in hip arthroscopy patients is high (61%). We recommend warming patients preoperatively with forced air warming devices to reduce this incidence.

The ubiquitination protein-protein interaction (PPI) network has been extensively explored in order to unravel the complexity of ubiquitin pathway. However, many significant challenges remain to develop a network-based understanding of the ubiquitination complexity including incompleteness of human interactome. Therefore, we aim to construct a pair of yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) vectors using pDEST32/pDEST22 vector system as a preparation for screening OTULIN-, OTUB1- and OTUB2-interacting proteins from human cDNA library, with ultimate aim of expanding the PPI network in human ubiquitome. Methods: OTULIN, OTUB1 and OTUB2 were cloned into entry vector using pCR™8/GW/TOPO® TA Cloning® system and shuttled into pDEST™32 bait vector by LR recombination reaction. To generate Y2H prey library clones, cDNA library was synthesized from HEK293 cells and cloned into donor vector pDONR™222 before transferred into destination vector pDEST™22. Results: DNA sequencing analysis confirmed the correct sequence of OTULIN, OTUB1 and OTUB2 inserts in pDEST32. Meanwhile, generation of cDNA library in pDEST22 produced 5.2 x 106 clones. Randomly picked pDEST22-cDNA clones showed that the recombination rate was 83% and gel electrophoresis indicated that the inserts length ranged from 0.45 to 3.4 kb. Conclusion: OTULIN, OTUB1, OTUB2 and cDNA library were successfully cloned into Y2H bait and prey vectors. The clones have been transfected into competent yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain MaV203 and Y2H experiment to screen novel OTULIN-, OTUB1- and OTUB2-interacting protein from human cDNA library is underway. © 2019 UPM Press.

In order to improve the safety of spacecraft, the characteristics of polyimide debris clouds produced by hypervelocity impact should be studied. Firstly, a Mie-Grüneisen equation of state based on the shock adiabat for polyimide, which describes the mechanical behavior in the numerical simulation, was obtained from hypervelocity impact experiments, then a 3-dimentional smoothed particle hydrodynamics program was compiled to numerically simulate the hypervelocity impact between aluminum projectiles (orbital debris) and polyimide targets with different impact velocities (3 km/s, 5 km/s, 8 km/s) and angles (0°, 30°, 45°, 60°), finally typical shapes of debris clouds produced in different impact velocities and angles were collected from simulation results, the characteristics of which were systemically discussed. © 2019 Editorial Department of Journal of Beijing Institute of Technology."
"Show me the money: The importance of eu funding for the activities of interest groups in post-socialist countries","2019","Romanian Journal of Political Science","0","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85086738003&partnerID=40&md5=4d03b6e954785a0aeaa1147866945a57","With pressures stemming from the increasing dissatisfaction with the democratic deficit, the European Union (EU) has taken different measures for getting closer to its citizens. One such measure is the European Commission’s funding of interest groups, which consequently encourages their formal and informal participation in EU policymaking. In this way, the EU also supports interest groups in their generating of expertise and giving valuable information to EU officials who are preparing legislation. In this article we analyse the main characteristics of national interest groups from selected Central and Eastern European post-socialist countries that receive EU money and at the same time are supposed to be supported with EU money vis-à-vis Western EU member-states to a lesser extent. The analysis is based on the data collected in frame of Comparative Interest Groups Survey project with a web survey that was conducted among national interest groups from Slovenia, Lithuania and Poland. The research results show that although EU funds are less important sources of funding than other sources, they have a substantial effect on interest groups in Central and Eastern Europe. Interest groups that receive EU funding have bigger budgets, better access to national and EU decision-makers and are more likely to lobby. © 2019, Romanian Academic Society. All rights reserved."

Designed by the phase cancellation principle, a conventional chessboard low RCS metasurface can be formed by polarization-dependent mushroom-shaped AMCs. Two new features are added to this design based on the conventional chessboard metasurface. Firstly, the long edge of the metallic patch on the AMC element is concave to obtain a broader bandwidth. Then, the width of the patch in each AMC block is tapered in one direction to further extend the operating bandwidth for RCS reduction. The backscattered RCS of the tapered AMC reflector is numerically investigated and compared with a non-tapered one. It is found that by introducing the above features, an RCS reduction greater than 10 dB can be obtained by the reflectors with relative bandwidth of 46% in the X-band. © 2019 Editorial Department of Journal of Beijing Institute of Technology."

In a container vessel structure, almost the entire deck space is occupied by hatches, leaving a narrow strip of deck plating outboard. This calls for a topside structure of heavy plating or a double hull to provide material in tension, stiffness against lateral and torsional loads, and resistance to buckling in compression when the vessel is in sagging condition. For sea going open deck vessels, torsional loading plays a predominant part to the hull girder strength and for inland navigation open deck vessels; the effect of torsion is rather negligible. Keeping this scenario in mind, the aim of this project is to investigate the hull strength of a river sea container vessel under combined bending and torsional loading to study the effect of torsion on river sea open deck vessel. To perform the strength analysis, firstly, a finite element model is created using Femap with NX Nastran software for the investigated vessel. Therefore, still water and wave loads are calculated using direct calculation. To find out the still water loads Argos software is used and for the wave induced loads potential flow software Hydrostar is used. Next, Finite element model is verified with classical beam theory and thin wall girder theory. Then the effect of various loading conditions on structural response is investigated. After, structural response of different hull configurations are scrutinized under combined bending and torsional loading. Finally, some recommendations are proposed for structural response of river sea container vessel subjected to combined bending and torsional loading. © 2019: The Royal Institution of Naval Architects"

It has to be remembered, however, that on the supranational level it is more difficult to achieve democracy than on a national level. Author went towards identifying the constituent components of the concept of ‘supranational democracy’ and the sources of this phenomenon in the European Union because democracy can have its natural environment not only in the nationstate, but also beyond the state. The theory of supranationalism will be the paradigm of the analysis, but in combination with Multi-level Governance (MLG) and theory of democracy, which is a particular point of reference and a classic reference in the process of explication.

Social capital is an elusive concept. It has its origin in a number of disciplines and, as a consequence, it is a mix of disparate and intangible concepts such as trust, reciprocity, norms and cooperation. It has been argued that there is a strong positive correlation between the acquisition of social capital and social and economic wellbeing. In order to determine if the use of HF radio promoted the development of social capital, qualitative data was collected from 32 NT self-identified HF radio users. Although manned operations of the Darwin-based HF coastal radio service ceased on 30 June 2002, the evidence indicates that HF radio was instrumental in the development of a sense of community amongst its widely dispersed and isolated users. The social capital outcomes of HF radio use that included social and economic well-being, engagement in participatory democracy and the acquisition of human capital were precipitated by the shared community concept of trust, informal and formal networks and cross-cutting ties.

Methods: Duration, distance and velocity of hyoid excursion were calculated using videofluoroscopic swallowing examinations (VFSEs) of 39 post-stroke survivors. Statistical comparisons were made using a two-way repeated measure analysis of variance (ANOVA) with between subject variable being aspirators and non-aspirators, and within subject variable being bolus volume (5 mL and 10 mL). The significance level was set as p<0.05. Results: The duration of hyoid excursion in aspirators was significantly slower than in nonaspirators. There were no significant differences in hyoid velocity or distance between aspirators and non-aspirators. Conclusions: Slower hyoid excursion duration may put stroke survivors at risk of aspiration. It is necessary for the clinician to design the intervention strategies to compensate for or rehabilitate from slow hyoid excursion in stroke survivors. © 2018 The Korean Association of Speech-Language Pathologists."

I first focus on conceptualizing the strong correlation between demographic transitions and modernity in Korea. The notions of developmentalism and the modern family claimed their places as the central organizing principles of Korean society and Korean citizens, and the desire of their lives. In the process of modernization, which was justified by the ideologies of development and the modern family, and its worsening contradictions, demographic transition occurred in a compressed manner. It must be also noted that while the races towards the desire for a standard modern life as well as the breakaway from it proceed in parallel to one another, the political conflicts reflecting the gap between realistic conditions and desires, values, and institutional regulations, are growing worse. Conservative administrations claimed they would solve the low birthrate, aging population problem by revitalizing the economy and making families wholesome again. However, conservative policies have roused considerable resistance from young women. The progressive bloc which had promised bold social reforms has not been able to truly empathize with the suffering of those unable to adapt to the systems of the modern family and development, those who are excluded and struggling through life. © 2019 Institute of Social Development and Policy Research, Seoul National University ."

By looking into the way the party establishes and develops itself, and its member recruitment style, this paper shows that the influence of Middle Eastern scholars on the party's ideology is relatively significant. The emergence of what was known in Indonesia as the dakwah or tarbiyah movement, which later came to influence the establishment of PKS, was in fact an extension of the movements promoted by Abu A'la Maududi in Pakistan and Hassan al-Banna in Egypt. For the PKS, books written by Maududi and al-Banna have become main sources for its members' training activity, known as the liqo activity. The liqo training method, one would argue, is clearly akin to the one used by the Egyptian al-Ikhwan al-Muslimun movement to recruit its members, except that to the Ikhwan group, the liqo is actually termed as usrah. With its systematic method of gathering, each member of the PKS who has attended the liqo for a long period and considered capable enough to translate the knowledge gained, is urged to create another new liqo group and try to recruit new members. © 2019 Kolej University Islam Sultan Azlan Shah."

This paper aims to theoretically analyze the vibration behaviors of inclined fluid-transporting free-spanning submarine pipelines in the deepwater area. The mathematical model for the vibration of inclined fluid-transporting pipelines is established considering the influence of gravity on vibration response, and a non-linear wake oscillator is employed to model the vortex shedding behind the pipeline free span. The partial differential equation system is solved through the generalized integral transform technique (GITT), which is an analytical or semi-analytical method. Parametric analysis are carried out to investigate the effects of the inclination on the dynamic response of fluid-transporting pipelines. It is found that the inclination of the free-spanning pipeline will radically alter the natural frequency of the structure, and consequently the VIV lock-in region.

It also examines whether SC improves community-based integrated care systems by increasing individuals' self-rated health and subjective well-being. First, multiple regression analysis is conducted based on data from a survey conducted in 2017-18 in Kawasaki, Japan, (2,457 respondents, 44.8% valid). The results show that two components of SC, regional trust and participation in horizontal networks, affect self-rated health and subjective well-being, even controlling for socioeconomic status. Second, propensity score analysis clarifies that SC promotes self-rated health and subjective well-being, but not vice versa. Finally, the study concludes that in aiming to improve self-rated health and subjective well-being, approaching the whole population, not only its high-risk members, is more effective. This study concludes that enhancing individual and regional SC will improve community-based integrated care systems in Kawasaki, which are inclusive of all citizens. © 2019 Institute of Social Development and Policy Research, Seoul National University ."

The conceptual heterogeneity of fixed coupon bonds traded in the global markets imposes a high degree of complexity on their comparative analysis. Contrary to baseline fixed income theory, in practice, most bonds feature coupon period irregularities. In addition, there are a multitude of day count methods that determine the interest accrual, the cash flows and the discount factors used in bond valuation. Several R packages, e.g., fBonds, RQuantLib, and YieldCurve, provide tools for fixed income analysis. Nevertheless, none of them is capable of evaluating bonds featuring irregular first and/or final coupon periods, and neither provides adequate coverage of day count conventions currently used in the global bond markets. The R package BondValuation closes this gap using the generalized valuation methodology presented in Djatschenko (2019). © 2020, Technische Universitaet Wien."

Clothing belongs to a category of objects, which includes talismans and masks, that Leiris calls 'choses d'apparat' because of their tendency to acquire a ceremonial significance. As such, they mark indelibly the travellers' first impressions of the men and women they encounter. Leiris's substantial body of autobiographical writing shows that his interest in clothing is not limited to his travels but goes back to his most distant childhood memories, in which items of dress acquire a distinct theatrical significance. The present study examines the descriptions of dress in L'Afrique fantôme in terms of what they reveal about the respective attitudes of the European travellers and local populations they meet. It explains also how dress habits function as a bearer of cultural values and as a mediator in situations of intercultural contact. It shows finally how dress plays a key part in Leiris's critique of exoticism and colonial stereotypes, by means of which he engages in a different kind of human exchange than that practiced by his scientifically trained colleagues.  © Intellect Ltd 2019."

This paper studies the spread of intrastate war as a result of another intrastate war in a neighboring country using a system dynamics modeling approach. The model employed is a modification of the SIR, a spread of disease model taken from epidemiology. Revising the SIR model with relevant political and economic variables, the model seeks to explain the mechanism through which an intrastate conflict is spread from an ""infected"" country to a ""susceptible"" country. Although diffusion and contagion of civil wars have been widely examined in the past, a dynamic modeling approach has not been adequately used in this area. Consistent with the existing literature, the results of the model suggest that refugees are a means to carry the conflict disease from the initial country by disturbing economic and social dynamics of the host whereas political capacity acts as the immune system, reducing the likelihood of conflict contagion. The results of the simulations, obtained using theoretical parameters, are mainly consistent with the expectations. © 2020, Center for Foreign Policy and Peace Research, Ihsan Dogramaci Peace Foundation."

Er:YAG laser (LightWalker AT, Fotona, Slovenia) was used in 27 patients with 27 leukoplakia lesions. Postoperative pain was assessed by use of visual analog scale (VAS), and the impact of laser treatment on the quality of life was assessed by the OHIP-14 questionnaire (Croatian version). Control group consisted of the same 27 patients previously treated with 1% topical isotretionin three times a day during the period of one year. No improvement in the size of leukoplakia lesions was observed after treatment with topical isotretinoin. There were significant differences between men and women according to leukoplakia localization, number of laser sessions and VAS (p<0.05). At follow-up after six months and one year, there was no recurrence of lesions. Er:YAG laser is a successful treatment for oral leukoplakia.

A velocity diagram is used to study speed and torque relationships. The results reveal that the torque amplification factor is the linear combination of the ratio of the differentials of the four elements and the ratio of planetary gear units, and its maximum value is easily more than 10. The E-TVDs with six elements are classified into three types, and there are six different configurations for each type. The torque amplification factor and the speed of interconnection between two planetary gear units are employed to evaluate the different characteristics of each E-TVD with six elements. The feasible configurations of a differential with four elements are also presented by the analysis of velocity level and planarity.

This study addresses the following primary research questions: How did the interplay of domestic, regional, and international developments lay the groundwork for the formation of the Sykes-Picot territorial order? How was the administrative structure and regional divisions before the Sykes-Picot agreement and to which border categorizations did these structures correspond? Was the Sykes-Picot agreement the only international intervention that affected the borders of the region or were there other international interventions before the Sykes-Picot agreement? This study argues that the history of Middle Eastern border formation is not only an international one but also involves many aspects that have not widely been taken into consideration. In doing so, this paper adopts a critical historical perspective to analyze the evolution of Middle Eastern borders. This paper proposes a three-tracked evolutionary analytical framework (frontiers, boundaries, borders) to analyze the emergence of borders and applies it to the emergence of Ottoman territoriality.

This research studied the effects of five reaching factors on the elder MRE including shoulder deviation on horizontal location (60° to 180°), shoulder deviation on the vertical location (-50° to 90°), body posture (sitting/standing), laterality (left/right), and gender (male/female). Thirty Thai elders aged range between 60-75 years old were recruited to the study. Using the in-house design guide rail, test participants demonstrated their maximum voluntary reaching movement by moving his/her arm upward. For each trial, the plane was located to reflect different shoulder deviation. The motion capture device was used to track participant's reach endpoints. Generally, the most significant difference was found with gender and laterality (p-value < 0.00). Male has longer reach distance than female. Reaching with right hand is farther than left hand. Participants reach at greater distance in standing as compared to sitting (p-value = 0.001). Interaction effects between horizontal and vertical location was significant (p-value = 0.004). Typically, elders reached more upward than downward. Horizontal location shows to have effect only when accompany with extreme vertical reach.

However, studies on the susceptibility rate of Enterococcus faecalis against fosfomycin are inadequate. Hence, this study was aimed to determine the invitro susceptibility to fosfomycinamong urinary E. faecalis. A total of about 70 non-repetitive isolates of Enterococcus faecalis isolated from the urine samples were included in the study. Susceptibility to fosfomycin, linezolid, teicoplanin, high level gentamicin, high level streptomycin was determined by Kirby Bauer disk diffusion method. Preliminary screening to minimum inhibitory concentration of high level aminoglycosides was assessed by agar dilution method. Vancomycin resistance was detected by agar screening method and further confirmed with e-test and interpreted as per CLSI guidelines. Our results indicate, increased susceptibility to teicoplanin (98.57%) followed by fosfomycin (95.71%) and linezolid (68.57%). Of note, none of the isolates were resistant to vancomycin. Of the 70 E. faecalis isolates screened, 61.43% isolates exhibited HLGR phenotype) and 37.14% exhibited HLSR phenotype. HLGRHLSR phenotype was observed among 32.9% of the isolates. MIC of gentamicin and streptomycin was found to be ≥512µg/ mL (HLGR isolates) and ≥2000µg/mL (HLSR isolates) respectively. 91.3% of our HLAR isolates (93% HLGR, 92.3% HLSR) were susceptible to fosfomycin. Hence, it could be speculated that fosfomycin can be considered in the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections caused by high level aminoglycoside/ linezolid resistant/glycopeptide resistant E.faecalis. © 2019, Indian Journal of Public Health Research and Development.

However, even the most stable Trp-cage circular permutants are still less stable than the analogous standard topology (std) Trp-cages. Extending mutational studies of Trp-cage fold stability to cp-species, including analogs lacking chain terminal charges, has uncovered and quantitated some additional stabilizing and destabilizing interactions. Upon protonation, the circular permutants are destabilized to a much greater extent than the standard topology series. End effects, particularly Coulombic interactions, appear to be more important for the cp-series while the Y10/P4 interaction in the cp-series is not as significant a stabilizing feature as the corresponding Y3/P19 in the standard topology series. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."

Four sections of a two-lane highway that have different shoulder widths were selected for the study. Under prevailing conditions, a two-lane highway with a shoulder width of fewer than 1.5 meters will cause a motorcycle to interfere with the carriageway and other impact factors that make capacity significantly less than HCM2010 calculation. The analysis of the base conditions model determined that the maximum capacity of a two-lane highway with a shoulder width of 2.0 meters was 1979 passenger car/hour/direction. Two-lane highways with shoulder widths of 1.5, 1.0 and 0.5 meters recorded maximum capacity at 1914, 1860 and 1789 passenger car/hour/direction, respectively, with all results higher than the HCM 2010 calculation. Model equations for capacity estimation were developed using multiple linear regression analysis derived from the relationships between capacity, shoulder width, and other affecting factors.

Consumers may receive external exposure by radiation emitted by progeny radionuclides in uranium and thorium, and internal exposure through the breathing of radon progeny radionuclides produced in the decay chain. Thus, in this study, age specific dose conversion factors (mSv y−1 Bq−1) by external exposure and dose conversion factors by internal exposure (mSv y−1 per Bq m−3) were derived. Besides, a dose assessment program were developed to calculate dose by taking into account real conditions. And the age specific dose was evaluated using the radioactive concentration measured by the NSSC. As a results, external exposure was assessed to get effective doses in the range of 0.00086 to 0.0015 mSv y−1 by external exposure and a committed effective doses in the range of 1.3 to 12.26 mSv y−1 by internal exposure for all age groups. © The Author(s) 2019.

In this paper, the curved bridge web is equivalent to an isotropic cylindrical flat shell, and the double triangular series satisfying four-edge simply supported boundaries are used as the displacement function of the shell. Then by means of the Galerkin method, the analytical formula for elastic shear buckling stress of curved bridge webs is deduced. The parameter studies show that the shear buckling coefficient kc of curved bridge webs is positively correlated with the parameter h2/(Rt), and negatively correlated with the length-height ratio l/h. This implies that the elastic shear buckling stress of a curved bridge web is larger than that of an equivalent straight bridge web. For a curved bridge with the parameter h2/(Rt) less than 2, the amount of increase is less than 4.5%. The elastic shear buckling stress of curved bridge webs can be estimated conservatively as the webs in straight bridges. While for a curved bridge with larger h2/(Rt), using the equations for straight girders to calculate the elastic shear buckling stress is too conservative. The proposed formulas provide a more accurate estimation for shear buckling stress of curved bridge webs. © 2019, The Editorial Department of Journal of Harbin Institute of Technology.

We evaluated the clinical utility of total circulating cell-free DNA as a non-invasive dual-purpose pan-cancer screening and early-detection tool. Material & Methods: The study recruited 159 newly diagnosed, therapy naïve patients spanning 16 cancer types as well as 12 asymptomatic (healthy) volunteers who provided signed informed consent. Ten mL of peripheral blood sample was collected from consenting participants, from which cfDNA was purified from the plasma. cfDNA concentrations were determined and correlated with disease status of each participant. Mann-Whitney U test was employed to determine statistical significance. Results: Patients with Lymphoma were found to have significantly (p<0.05) elevated plasma cfDNA concentrations (15.61ng/μL) as compared to asymptomatic individuals (4.22ng/μL). No significant differences were determined between plasma cfDNA concentrations in diagnosed patients and asymptomatic individuals in any of the cancer types. Conclusion: We hypothesize that analysis of larger sub-cohorts of individual cancer types in a larger multi-center study is required to unambiguously establish statistically significant differences (or lack of the same) in cfDNA concentrations between diagnosed cases and asymptomatic individuals. © 2019 Pravara Institute of Medical Sciences.

Some have argued within the domains of international politics that there is great need for UN peace keeping missions to be privatised as they have greatly failed to tackle conflict and contribute towards peace keeping in many countires. By strictly examining relevant literature, the study, uncovered that UN missions have been trapped in a cycle of never ending conflict rather than reducing the violence and protecting civilians. The study concluded that rather than solving the conflicts, the UN has found itself in a conundrum rather opportunity. The study therefore, recommended that closer cooperation between the UN and host nations and rapid deployment in times of crisis are keys to ensuring better peace keeping operations. © 2019 Adonis and Abbey Publishers Ltd.

As a cross-border crime, human trafficking has become a concern to policymakers and other stakeholders in South Africa. Although a global phenomenon, its extent and gruesome nature has led to the exploitation, traumatisation and untimely deaths of several people, particularly women and children. The impact of this crime has prompted numerous interventions from several actors across the globe. Humanitarian concerns have also engendered the introduction of the Prevention and Combating of Trafficking in Persons Act 7 of 2013, by the South African government. Unfortunately, this comprehensive legislation, and other efforts, have not assisted in combating the crime, given its rising waves lately. From the findings of doctoral research that was conducted through a qualitative approach, we found that most victims of trafficking, chiefly youths and children, do not have adequate understanding of what trafficking entails and the risks involved. The study also found that introducing modules on human trafficking into the educational curriculum will assist in consolidating the efforts of the State in reducing the supply end of the illicit trade. © 2019 Adonis and Abbey Publishers Ltd.

They are known to adhere to old, ancient methods of managing illness. This study was undertaken to understand the issues and challenges in the tribal areas in seeking healthcare. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cross-sectional study was conducted during the year 2017 in a nongovernmental organization-based health center located in a tribal area of rural Maharashtra, India. A total of 383 participants were interviewed using a semi-structured questionnaire about the health-seeking behavior and utilization of health services in the study center as well as nearby government facilities. Strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats of the management of diseases at the study center were also identified. RESULTS: In the event of an acute illness, 40% preferred government hospital, 40% private, 16% of study center, and 4% sought treatment from traditional healers. On comparison with nearby government facilities, the study center was located far away, travel time and fare to reach was more and was preferred by all over government facilities. The difference in user perspective about both facilities was statistically significant (P < 0.00001). All of them trusted the staff and the services provided at the study center completely. Around 97% thought the services were made according to their convenience. About 59% spent on drugs and logistics after visiting the nearest government facility, whereas only 10.8% admitted to having spent on drugs and logistics after visiting the study center.

Most literature regarding the STN describes and analyzes only its roll in motor function. We present the case of a 37-year-old woman and describe multiple cognitive, behavioral, and personality changes following surgical clipping for a ruptured left-middle cerebral artery aneurysm and a subsequent left STN infarct; no other cortical or subcortical structural lesions were found. After the incident, the patient presented with cognitive and behavioral changes, although more relevant changes were observed in her social and affective interaction patterns (i.e., personality), which were presumably influenced by negative early-life experiences. A neuropsychological assessment demonstrated normal IQ with mild attentional and executive deficiencies; personality changes were documented using a semi-structured interview. Her interaction patterns changed from a dysfunctional tendency to be emotionally distant, uncommunicative, bad-tempered, and physically aggressive to a puerile, affectionate, caring, and sociable pattern of interaction, which resulted in improved family relations. Cognitive and affective changes related to STN lesions and stimulation have, in part, been explained by the inhibitory and action-selection functions within fronto-striatal circuits, although few studies describe and analyze personality changes; most report negative changes, in contrast to the case presented here. © Archivos de Neurociencias"

Our method enables us to reduce the dimensionality of time series both in degrees of freedom and frequency so that characteristic features of oscillatory behavior can be captured. To test the new method, we apply WlPCA to a non-autonomous model of multiple degrees of freedom, the Froeschlé maps of $N=2$ and $N=4$, which correspond to autonomous systems of three and five degrees of freedom, respectively. The eigenvalues and eigenvectors obtained by WlPCA reveal those times when frequency variation exhibits switching between relatively stationary features. Moreover, further analyses indicate which degrees of freedom and frequencies are involved in the switching. We confirm that the switching corresponds to the onset of transport in phase space. These findings imply that, even for systems of larger degrees of freedom, barriers can exist in phase space that block transport for a finite time, thereby dividing the phase space into multiple quasi-stationary regions. Thus, our method is promising for understanding dynamics in systems of many degrees of freedom, such as vibrational-energy redistribution in molecules. © 2019 The Author(s).

These questions will be answered by looking at the results of a preliminary study on the reception and subsequent institutionalisation of studies on human rights in stable structures that are dedicated to their research, training and dissemination in Spanish universities. The starting hypothesis is that this institutionalisation causes conceptual, epistemological and methodological biases in the rationales for knowledge construction in the field of human rights that determine and hinder the interdisciplinary approach demanded by its study. Interdisciplinarity has become a dominant aspect of human rights research. The question about how this feature is articulated and who articulates it in the academic institutional framework is pertinent in a field of knowledge that cannot avoid asymmetries in the production and circulation of knowledge. The results show that human rights research has been mainly institutionalised in stable university structures in Spain within the field of legal sciences, with a clear predominance of the area of the Philosophy of Law. It can be concluded that this has been conditioned by the reception and subsequent development of the study of human rights in Spain. While it has been found that the line developed by these centres and research groups has been consolidated and recognised, it can also be confirmed that their modes of knowledge production do not match the rationale of interdisciplinary research. These limitations are not just endogenous. There are some features of Spanish institutional R&D&i culture that make interdisciplinary research on human rights difficult. © 2019 Age of Human Rights Journal. All rights reserved."

The effects of different parameters, such as the initial bubble location, the mold rotational speed and the mold rotational direction on the bubble in the migration process are investigated. The results show that the bubble migration can be divided into the radial movement to the mould rotation axis and the circular movement to the mould wall opposite to rotational direction of the casting mould. The casting mould wall has an impeditive effect on the circular movement of the bubble during its migration process. And the bubble finally migrates like a straight line along the mould wall located at the opposite direction of the rotational casting mould whether it rotates clockwise or anti-clockwise. The bubbles at the position near the mould wall located at the opposite direction of the rotational casting mould are much easier to migrate in a straight line. The instantaneous speed of the gas bubble increases with the increment of the mould rotational speed. However the mould rotational speed is high or low, the moving speed of the gas bubble increases slightly at the primary stage, and then decreases gradually like a ladder. © 2019, The Editorial Department of Journal of Harbin Institute of Technology.

The measures of TAD, CTD, and NSA after six-months of follow-up were assessed. In addition, variables such as demographic data, fracture side, duration of operation, blood loss volume, weight bearing day, and Harris hip score (HHS) were analyzed. The relationship between post-operation CTD and TAD, NSA changes after six months of followup was analyzed. All data was analyzed using SPSS 20 software (SPSS, IBM Inc., USA). The significance level for all tests was considered to be 0.05. Results: This study evaluated 24 patients. The mean age of the patients was 69.9 ± 12.00 years, and 15 (62.5%) of them were male. No significant correlations were seen in the collected data, especially CTD and NSA changes after six-months of follow-up (p>0.05). Maximum and minimum TAD values after surgery were 25.6 and 11.0, respectively. Maximum and minimum TAD values at the six-month follow-up were 34.9 and 11.0, respectively. Mean TAD was constant at 19.8±5.3 in postoperative and follow-up measurements. This shows that patients experienced increases in TAD and others experienced decreases in TAD within the six months of follow-up. Conclusion: The results showed that despite the abnormal CTD after surgery, the risk of TAD changes increased. Generally, TAD is a well-established radiographic measurement for predicting the risk of cut-out. CTD and TAD can be used together or separately to predict the risk of DHS screw cut-out in patients with intertrochanteric fractures in future studies. Copyright © 2019 The Author(s)."

Channel bed forms, cross-sectional shapes, channel geometry, etc. have direct interactions among flow, sediment, and the channel boundaries and any untoward reaction through anthropo-geogenic activity to disrupt the riverine ecology can lead to degenerations of channel. The present work has been focused to analyze the impact of anthropo-geographic implications on river habitat change through hydro-geomorphological study. The river Magurmari flowing through the Sub-Himalayan foothills of Darjeeling is of such kind which is degenerating and decaying over time and is losing its vivacity. The main objective of the work is to find out the interrelations of the hydraulic parameters as indicators of level of degeneration in view of their natural setup especially rainfall regime and head water supply. Field works with leveling surveys to draft the cross sections and measurement of hydraulic characteristics have carried out by the authors. Empirical formulae have been calculated to find the results and to analyze their interrelations. Moreover, map works have been done under GIS environment as the allied methodological attempts. Finally, findings on river habitat Survey through rating magnitudes in Likert scale and hydraulic impact study have been done. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG."

Rausch) are often attacked by pests, which usually cause the decrease of raw material yield and its quality. The objects of field trial were two chamomile cultivars: Złoty Łan (4n) and Promyk (2n) cultivated under organic regime. The aim of this study was to evaluate of impact of the spinosad treatment and its time of application on two chamomile cultivars: Cv. Promyk-2n and cv. Złoty Łan-4n exposed to insect pests. Methods: The first treatment with spinosad as a preventative control (P) was performed in the early phase of plant development (seven leaves). Intervention (I) treatment was made in green bud phase. In both terms of observation insect pests were observed and collected. In each spraying application of 0.06 g of spinosad per 1 liter of water was used. Results: Spinosad was able to limit the number of pest population and finally increased yielding of the treated cultivars as compared to the untreated plants. Time of spinosad application for cv. Złoty Łan plants was not statistically siginificant, although was more effective for the preventative treatment of cv. Promyk in the increasing of the plant biomass (283.8 g · m-2) and seed (32 g · m-2) yields than intervention. Conclusion: Protection treatment with spinosad might be recommended in chamomile cultivation and it is more effective than intervention in diploid cultivar which begin blooming earlier than tetraploid. Essential oil content was not related with protection treatment for diploid cultivar, although intervention in tetraploid cultivar caused higher content of oil. © 2019 Jolanta Kowalska et al."

In such a case, ground improvement or reinforcing of the ground is necessary to obtain the required bearing capacity. This paper deals with the use of geosynthetics to reinforce the ground for reducing ground deformation and increasing bearing capacity of the ground. This research is mainly focused on the soft clay soil which is more problematic than the sandy soils with respect to the building foundation of infrastructures. Here, numerical analysis has been carried out with the finite element method, using the elastoplastic sub loading tij model. Bearing capacities for different over consolidation ratios (OCRs)and changing the depth of the reinforcement are compared. Bearing capacity is also checked replacing the soft clay with granular soil in between the foundation and reinforcement. It is found that reinforcement increases the bearing capacity of the soft clay and the increment of the bearing capacity depends on the depth of the reinforcement, OCR and improved area of the ground underneath the foundation. © 2019 Int.

This lack of diversity may limit organizational performance and hinder a firms' ability to fill employment needs with talented individuals. Undergraduate construction management programs can support the construction industry by attracting and retaining a diverse student population. Previous findings indicate that promoting a sense of community is an important factor in supporting underrepresented populations in construction programs. This study proposes a method for collecting and analyzing self-reported sense of community across a construction management program. A previously validated survey instrument was used to measure sense of community within a construction program and investigate differences between demographic groups. The findings provide baseline values for benchmarking sense of community and an investigation of differences in the reported sense of community between demographic groups.

Idle user equipments (UE) are used to cooperatively transmit jamming signal to confuse eavesdroppers (Eve). We propose a threshold-based jammer selection scheme to decide which idle UE should participate in the transmission of jamming signal. Threshold conditions are carefully designed to decrease interference to legitimate channel, while maintain the interference to the Eves. Moreover, fewer UE are activated, which is helpful for saving energy consumptions of cooperative UEs. Analytical expressions of the connection and secrecy performances are derived, which are validated through Monte Carlo simulations. Theoretical and simulation results reveal that our proposed scheme can improve connection performance, while approaches the secrecy performance of [12]. Furthermore, only 43% idle UEs of [12] are used for cooperative jamming, which helps to decrease energy consumption of network.

To accomplish this, the study employed a qualitative research method; were a systematic review of the literature relating to regional integration within the context of the SADC and ASEAN was undertaken, subsequently, the study utilized thematic content analysis to deduce its findings with the hope of bringing meaning to the overall content of the paper. The study found that ASEAN has undertaken significant strides aimed at deepening regional integration which has contributed immensely to the development, market growth and expansion of the region, however from a SADC perspective, political disagreements, competing member state interests are some of the factors hindering the SADC from deepening regional integration despite it being an important need for regional leaders.

For this manner, it is assumed that inert gas is transported through the body to various organs via the blood stream. In this simulation, a voltage source is equivalent to gas generation in the atmosphere, the conductivity is equivalent to the cardiac output of the organ, the capacitor capacitance is equivalent to the volume of blood or tissue and voltage across a capacitor is equivalent to the gas concentration in air or blood or a tissue. This simulation can be used to study the dynamics of any inert gas whose partition coefficients are known. We use this simulation to study the dynamics of radon in human body. The physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model that describes the fate of radon in systemic tissue has been used for this simulation. Using this simulation, the effective dose equivalent resulting from inhalation of radon has been estimated. The calculated values agree with the previously reported value. Also, using the model, it has been shown that after inhalation of radon gas, absorbed dose has been decreased in different tissues by increasing the inhalation rate without radon. So that, by doubling the inhalation rate and the rate of cardiac output, the value of the absorbed dose has been decreased 11.88% in the adipose tissue, 25.49% in the red marrow tissue and 20.3% in the liver organ. © The Author(s) 2019.

The task was to grip the handlebar for 5 minutes with 50% perceived strength under two conditions: with handle vibration (HV) and without handle vibration (NHV). Activities of forearm muscles namely flexor carpi radialis (FCR), flexor of the fingers (FF), flexor carpi ulnaris (FCU), and extensor digitorum (ED) were recorded using surface electromyography (EMG), while post-task hand tests for finger dexterity, strength, and sensibility were also measured. These finger functions as well as muscle responses did not differ significantly between HV and NHV. The lacking effects might be associated to the inconsistencies on grip force during task, perhaps participants let go of the handle during the latter part. Meanwhile, perceived discomfort on the shoulder was significantly higher after HV than NHV and activity of FCR, FF, and ED during maximal grip test were significantly different (p < 0.05) as well. Specifically, muscle activities were lower by 12-15% after HV than NHV, indicating that HV might have influenced the ability to grip hardly. In conclusion, maximal grip test and discomfort rating can be a predictive parameter to determine the instantaneous effects of handle vibration. © 2019 KIIE."

This differential equation possesses two main components: one is a stress function to accommodate the adopted fatigue criterion and the other one is a characteristic damage function that serves to capture the HCF response of alloys. Two distinct characteristic damage functions with three different multiaxial fatigue criteria, namely Sines, Crossland, and Dang Van criteria, are examined to develop six (out of many possible) variants of the presented damage accumulation model. As a validation measure, Chaboche's HCF damage model is retrieved as a specific case of the developed formalism. For model parameters identification, an ad hoc two-level identification scheme is designed and numerically verified. It is demonstrated that endurance limit, which is determined from fully reversed HCF tests (i.e., R=-1), can be identified from fatigue tests with positive stress ratio (R >0), thus making our development quite suitable for specimens prone to buckling under compression. Another salient feature of the devised identification scheme is its capability in extracting model parameters from noisy data. Copyright © 2019 by ASME."

There are established 14 subtypes of 5-HT receptors from which central 5-HT2Areceptors have facilitatory effect whereas 5-HT2C receptors have inhibitory effect on nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons. The aim of study is to evaluate effect of mirtazapine (MIR) 5-HT2A/2C antagonist pre-treatment on Stereotyped Behaviour (SB) induced by Apomorphine (APO) and Dexamphetamine (DAM) in rats. Material and Methods-Rats divided in 4 main groups and then each group was further subdivided further into 4 subgroups( n = 6). In each main group, one subgroup received dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and other subgroups received 5, 10 and 20 mg/kg mirtazapine pre-treatment intraperitoneally respectively. Then after one hour animals received the respective dose of APO /DAM then we scored SB in each rat at every 10 min testing time intervals for 90 and 180 min respectively. Control group values were compared with different doses valuesof MIR. Results - Pre-treatment with 5, 10 and 20 mg/kg mirtazapine did not show significant influence on 1.5 and 3 mg/kg apomorphine induced SB in rats but these doses showed significant potentiation of 5 and 10 mg/kg dexamphetamine induced SB in rats. Conclusion - Mirtazapine did not show significant influence APO induced SB in rats indicates that MIR does not have direct DA receptor agonistic or antagonistic activity but these doses showed significant potentiation of DAM induced SB. Mirtazapine removes the inhibitory control of 5-HT on nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons by blocking central 5-HT2C receptors predominantly and results in potentiation of DAM induced SB. © 2019 Pravara Institute of Medical Sciences.

In 2011 the Hungarian government introduced the Act CCIX of 2011 on Water Utility Services which resulted in significant market consolidations. In this article we present the results of a qualitative survey carried out in 2015 to examine the opinion of top managers of utilities on the short and midterm effects of the realization of the objectives set by the Act. The interviews focused on examining the efficiency changes experienced by 15 CEOs of different water utility service provider companies since the integration. The paper also examines their expectations for the future across a multitude of technical and economic fields and factors. This qualitative research aimed to study whether the recent changes in policy and market structure led to economies of scale and to the perceptible increase of technical and economic efficiency levels. It was concluded that efficiency benefits of economies of scale prevailed in most cases, however, these were perceived only to a limited extent at the time of the survey, approximately midway through the ongoing integration processes. © 2019 The Author"
"The effect of venlafaxine on blood pressure and ECG in rats fed with high-fat-fructose diet","2019","Interdisciplinary Toxicology","0","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85085080797&doi=10.2478%2fintox-2019-0024&partnerID=40&md5=a12c3c83d2b497b735f75f5ca1125769","Metabolic syndrome represents one of the major health, social and economic issues nowadays, and affects more than 25% people worldwide. Being a multifactorial health problem, metabolic syndrome clusters various features, such as obesity, dyslipidemia, hyperglycemia and hypertension. Each of these disturbances represents a risk factor for developing cardiovascular disease. Moreover, patients with metabolic syndrome are more likely to suffer from depression, thus treatment with antidepressants (e.g. venlafaxine) is often neccessary. However, many of the antidepressants themselves may contribute to worsening or even development of the metabolic syndrome, thus creating a ""vicious circle"". The aim of this work was to investigate on the animal model of metabolic syndrome, i.e. on hypertriacylglycerolemic rats fed high-fat-fructose diet (HFFD): 1) the effect of a change in diet from HFFD to a standard diet (SD) and the effect of venlafaxine treatment, 2) during HFFD, 3) as well as during a changed diet to SD. We focused on biometric parameters, blood pressure and selected ECG parameters. We observed the reversibility of the present metabolic and cardiovascular changes by switching the HFFD to SD in the last 3 weeks of the experiment. Switch to the standard diet led to decrease of body weight, even in the presence of venlafaxine. Administration of venlafaxine caused the decrease of heart weight/body weight index in rats fed with HFFD compared to the untreated group fed with HFFD for 8 weeks. Blood pressure, which was increased in the HFFD group showed a tendency to decrease to control values after switching to the standard diet. Administration of venlafaxine led to significant increase in all parameters of blood pressure when rats were fed with HFFD throughout the whole experiment. In untreated rats fed with HFFD for 8 weeks, we observed a shorter PQ interval and prolonged QRS complex as well as QTc interval compared to untreated rats with diet switched to SD. This effect was potentiated by venlafaxine administered not only during HFFD but even after switch to SD. Our results point to the fact that metabolic syndrome is clearly affecting the function of the cardiovascular system by modifying blood pressure and electrical activity of the heart. Moreover, administration of venlafaxine may lead to worsening of the observed changes, especially in the presence of high-fat-fructose diet. © 2019 Michaela Sasváriová et al."

Drawing on two decades of research and mortality statistics (1995-2015) for 17 OECD countries, our analysis confirms and builds on the observed relationship between the returns and investments in health and social welfare spending. First, the results suggest that there is a differential effect of socioeconomic, lifestyle and demography variables on total and cause-specific mortality rates. Second, the basic premise of an association between health care expenditure and mortality rates is reinforced in models that take into account public-only health expenditure and its impact on older age groups. Third, a strong protective effect of government-sponsored welfare expenditure on infant mortality was observed. This effect is weaker on other causes of death and suggests that older individuals, in this sample of developed countries, may have reached a stage of the epidemiological transition in which health improvement is indifferent to government assistance and depends largely on behavioural change. © 2019 The Author(s)"

In this paper, the performance of an innovative anchor type, so-called Hotdog anchor, invented by Korean engineers is investigated using the numerical and field test methods for excavation in Southern Vietnam. For comparison, both hotdog and pack anchor types are introduced in the case study. Proof tests of anchors were also conducted to provide data for the simulation. Four layers of hotdog anchors with 12m-bond length and 40 cm-diameter are adopted to compare with 4 layers of 18m-bond length and 20cm-diameter pack anchors in a soft to medium clay layers (NSPT = 1 ~ 13). In numerical analysis, the soil behavior was simulated using the Mohr-Coulomb model. The plate and node-to-node anchor elements were adopted to model the diaphragm wall and the anchors, respectively. Results show that the hotdog anchors could provide the larger bearing capacity and so that decrease the required bond length as compared with the pack ones. Based on that a guideline for the adoption of hotdog anchor to deep excavations in thick soft soil deposit in Southern Vietnam was proposed. © 2020 Int. J. of GEOMATE."

First, the transfer matrix of a filter system connected to inlet and outlet pipes with conical sections is measured using a two-load method. Then, the transfer matrix of a particle filter only is extracted from the experiments by applying inverse matrices of the conical sections. In the analytical approaches, the one-dimensional acoustic model for the leakage between the filter and the housing is developed. The predicted transmission loss shows a good agreement with the experimental results. Compared to the baseline, the leakage between the filter and housing increases transmission loss at a certain frequency and its harmonics. In addition, the transmission loss for the system with a partially blocked filter is measured. The blockage of the filter also increases the transmission loss at higher frequencies. For the simplicity of experiments to identify the leakage and blockage, the reflection coefficients at the inlet of the filter system have been measured using two different downstream conditions: open pipe and highly absorptive terminations. The experiments show that with highly absorptive terminations, it is easier to see the difference between the baseline and the defects. © 2019 Institute of Noise Control Engineering."

Interesting investigation is being carried out into the possible relationship between this technique and the appearance over time of osteolytic phenomena or cement fragmentation in the intervened vertebrae. The objective of our study was to investigate whether there is a loss of effectiveness and/or safety of PVP with PMMA in the long term. Material and methods: X-rays were analyzed of intervened patients corresponding to the immediate post-operative and the most recent radiological study (PVP more than 15 years previous). With both radiological studies, we describe: the height of the vertebral body, the angulation of lamellar plates and osteolytic presence around the cement over time. Results: A total of 7 patients operated by PVP with PMMA 15 or more years earlier agreed to have a new radiograph in our center. After the analysis of their post-operative images (immediate and 15 or more years after surgery), no loss of height of the cemented vertebral body, differences in angulation in the lamellar plates, presence of osteolysis around the vertebrae was observed in any of the involved vertebrae cement or fragmentation of the injected PMMA. Conclusion: PMMA injected into the vertebral body remains stable over time (more than 15 years). There are no changes in the bone-PMMA interface, osteolysis and/or changes in the height of the vertebral bodies in the cases analyzed. © 2019 Sociedad Espanola de Investigacion Osea y del Metabolismo Mineral (SEIOMM).

"The Effect of Memantine Administration on Anxiety Maintenance in Stressed Male Wistar Rats","2019","Iranian Journal of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences","0","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85084649851&doi=10.5812%2fijpbs.89526&partnerID=40&md5=a00861b09135b0f9c4647ae58ddd04af","Background: Anxiety is considered as a chronic stress complication. The role of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptors located in basolateral amygdala (BLA) in stress-induced anxiety is hypothesized. Objectives: It is unknownhowNMDAglutamate receptors located in BLA affect maintenance of chronic stress-induced anxiety. This study investigated the role of these receptors in maintaining anxiety induced by electric foot shock in male Wistar rats. Methods: Animals were subjected to stress based on the following protocol: Seven days after bilateral cannulation in BLA, they experienced seven sessions of stress (one session/day). Before each stress session, the animals received different doses of memantine (1, 2.5, and 5 mg/kg) peripherally, or (0.1, 1 and 5-g/kg) in BLA. Six days after stress termination, the animals were tested for maintenance of anxiety using an open field paradigm. Moreover, the animals' brains were removed for further assessment of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels in the hippocampus. Results: The stressed animals showed anxiety six days after stress termination. Moreover, chronic peripheral and central memantine injection by itself showed both anxiolytic and anxiogenic properties six days after drug administration termination in the non-stressed animals. Memantine preadministration, both peripherally and centrally, reduced the stress-induced maintenance of anxiety in the stressed animals. The BDNF assessment revealed that stress and memantine did not change hippocampal BDNF level six days after drug or stress termination. Conclusions: Inhibition of NMDA receptors in BLA can inhibit maintenance of stress-induced anxiety, which is not related to hippocampal BDNF level. In addition, chronic memantine injection induces anxiety. © 2020, Author(s)."

Nevertheless, howsoever well-optimized a reasonably large muffler volume be (with respect to insertion loss, back pressure, breakout noise, flow noise, etc.), there are inevitably acoustic modes present, which lead to peaks in the noise levels and corresponding troughs in the insertion loss (IL) of an exhaust baseline. These acoustic modes are: (i) muffler internal modes, (ii) axial pipe modes and (iii) system modes. Of these, the axial pipe mode is the most detrimental one. Usage of microperforated (MPA) patches along long pipes at locations of sound pressure anti-nodality to dampen their resonances has proved to be an efficient acoustic solution. All the works reported so far on these resonance free pipes with such patches have been using 3D FEM or vehicle testing. This article discusses their acoustic performance employing linear plane wave theory. The predicted acoustic behavior comes in-line with those of published resources. Also, the flow leakage through the open patches and the corresponding attenuation impact have been demonstrated. It has been shown that the seemingly inconsequential leakage deteriorates the patch acoustics considerably. This result is verified with the published claims, thereby further validating the 1D analysis presented here. Also, the 1D approach has a scope for valuable benchmarking of resonance free pipes (RFP™) in industry since it does not suffer any intrinsic modeling deficiency unlike some commercial simulation solvers. The article, thus, presents, validates and illustrates the potential of linear acoustic analysis toward the acoustic assessment and optimization of RFPs. © 2019 Institute of Noise Control Engineering."

Large number of laboratory measurements using corresponding models allows deeper studying the fluoride mobility in contaminated soil in the vicinity of Ammophos production factory. In a series of column experiments the migration ability of fluoride was studied in Irragric Anthrosols of different particle size distribution and four different experiments using near neutral and acidic washing water in the low, moderate and highly contaminated soils. It has been established that studied soils, located in the zone of airborne emissions from the Ammophos production plants, have a weak fluoride-holding capacity. The intensity of fluoride migration was conditioned by the initial level of soil contamination. Repeated simulated irrigation of the soil didn't result in complete removal of fluoride. At low contamination level (3.5 mg F/kg soil) on sandy-loam soil, concentration of fluoride increased with increasing of the volume of leaching moisture. With medium contamination level (6.1 mg F/kg soil) on a loamy soil, the average leaching rate was near zero throughout the measurement interval. At high contamination level (17.5 mg/kg) on heavy textured soil, the increase in the concentration of fluoride in the eluates was observed throughout the entire study interval and posed a threat of ground water contamination. © 2019 Litvinovich et al."

Specific issues: Chronic pain at the amputation sites as well as phantom limb initially proved challenging to manage medically however were eventually controlled with careful consideration of analgesic regimens. Pain was measured using the Numeric Pain Rating Scale. A likely attributing cause for the pain was peripheral neuropathy. Management: A combination of neuropathic agents and opioids helped to control pain. These analgesic included amitriptyline, gabapentin, pregabalin, tramadol and morphine in various regimens. Paracetamol and ibuprofen were also used. Implications: Rigorous search strategies were created which interrogated the MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO databases for studies reporting limb pain management in electrocution injuries. A total of 841 studies were found with 583 screened after removal of duplicates. No RCTs could be identified investigating limb pain management in electrical injuries. Case reports and case series have described various treatment options including nerve blocks, neuropathic analgesia, physiotherapy, botulinum toxin, fracture fixation and even the use of Virtual Reality headsets. We discuss this available evidence. No consensus exists as to the optimum management approach of pain in such patients. From our experience with this patient we suggest that a multi- modal analgesic approach is likely to be needed in such patients and should therefore be considered. Level 1 research into pain management in electrocution injuries is required. Copyright © 2019 The Author(s)."
"Effectiveness of decreasing permeability and increasing shear strength of sandy soil using exopolysaccharide biopolymer","2019","International Journal of GEOMATE","0","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85084322759&doi=10.21660%2f2019.64.63608&partnerID=40&md5=e1bce681ae0c74023bf366cfec2d431c","Sand is a type of soil with high porosity and a tendency toward a high permeability rate and low shear strength, which often causes problems in terms of piping and low slope stability. Permeability and shear strength have a very close relationship with soil stability. In this paper, we analyzed the addition of the bacterial producer exopolysaccharide on sandy soil for increased instability. The addition of this bacterial producer is expected to improve soil stability by reducing its permeability and increasing its shear strength. To find an alternative approach to overcome the problems of low permeability and shear strength, experiments were conducted using five types of non-pathogenic inoculated bacterial producer, namely, Lactobacillus sakei, Agrobacterium tumifaciens, Bacillus subtilis, Pseudomonas sp, and Nitrobacter sp, added to five samples of river and beach sand. After 30 days of bacterial inoculation, the permeability of the sand samples was tested using a constant head test, and the shear strength was tested using a direct shear test, which was confirmed through scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Based on the permeability test, the permeability of the sand samples inoculated with Bacillus subtilis was reduced the most at 74.43%. Based on the direct shear test, the highest increase in shear strength, i.e., about 58.91%, was in the samples inoculated with Lactobacillus sakei. SEM photographs with 10,000 x magnification showed the presence of bacteria and the formation of extracellular polysaccharides in the walls of the sand, which affected the permeability reduction rate and increased the shear strength of the sand samples. Based on the permeability and shear strength results, it can be seen that the correlation between the two is weak, and thus when the shear strength of the sample increases, the permeability does not necessarily decrease; the correlation depends on the type and characteristics of the bacterial producer. © 2019 by the authors."

The subjects descended to a depth of 2 m relative to the sea level, breathed oxygen–nitrogen and oxygen–nitrogen–argon mixtures for ten days, and an oxygen–nitrogen–argon mixture when descended to a depth of 20 m for seven days. EEG was recorded from six subjects to estimate relative values of the main band powers, global correlation dimension D2 and to perform qualitative analysis of individual EEG patterns. Significant one-way shifts in the EEG quantitative and qualitative parameters were shown by the subjects at a depth of 20 m breathing the O2-N-Ar air mixture. When they breathed this mixture for ten days at a depth of 2 m, functioning of the brain cortex was almost optimal. Ten days in the hypoxic NO2 atmosphere did not cause any distinct changes in the EEG spectral parameters. © 2019, Pleiades Publishing, Inc."

Amongst the comorbidities, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is highly prevalent and associated with higher morbidity and mortality. We review the detection and treatment of T2DM in HF and the need to balance the risk of hypoglycaemia and overall glycaemic control. Despite large attributable risks, T2DM is often underdiagnosed in HF. Therefore there is a need for systematic monitoring (screening) for undetected T2DM in HF patients. Given that patients with HF are at greater risk for developing T2DM compared with the general population, an emphasis also has to be placed on regular reassessment of glycaemic status during follow-up. Therefore, glucose-lowering therapies (e.g. sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors, SGLT-2 inhibitors) with a known benefit for the prevention or delay of HF hospitalization could be considered early in the course of T2DM, to optimise treatment and reduce cardiovascular (CV) risk. Although intensive glycaemic control has been shown to effectively reduce the risk of microvascular complications in T2DM, these same trials have shown either no reduction in CV outcomes, or even an increase in mortality with tight glycaemic control (i.e. targeting HbA1c levels <7.0%). More lenient glycaemic targets (e.g. HbA1c levels 7.0-8.0%) may be more appropriate for HF patients with T2DM. The 2016 ESC Guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of HF proposed metformin as the first-line therapy, given its long-standing use and low risk of hypoglycaemia. More recently, several novel glucose lowering-medications have been introduced, including dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RA), and SGLT-2 inhibitors. The most consistent reduction in the risk of HF hospitalisation has been shown with the three SGLT-2 inhibitors (empagliflozin, canagliflozin and dapagliflozin) which now offer improved outcomes in patients with both HF and T2DM. © The Author(s) 2019."

We argue that Males J's rejection of AG Wathelet's hypothesis in his Gazprom opinion to the effect that the Regulation (recast) has overruled West Tankers is largely persuasive. At the same time, we also identify two problematic aspects of the judgment. Namely, we contend that the High Court was arguably wrong (i) to interpret AG Wathelet as envisaging that a case would 'move in and out' of the Regulation and (ii) to interpret Gazprom as holding that Member State courts are permitted to enforce all arbitral 'anti-suit' awards, including those enjoining a party from litigating in another EU Member State. © 2019 The Author(s) 2019.

Idle UAVs may work as relays between the sources and destinations to enhance communication quality. In this letter, we investigate the opportunistic relay selection for the UAVs dynamic network. On account of the time-varying channel states and the variable numbers of sources and relays, relay selection becomes much more difficult. In addition, information exchange among all nodes may bring much cost and it is difficult to implement in practice. Thus, we propose a decentralized relay selection approach based on mood-driven mechanism to combat the dynamic characteristics, aiming to maximize the total capacity of the network without information exchange. With the proposed approach, the sources can make decisions only according to their own current states and update states according to immediate rewards. Numerical results show that the proposed approach has attractive properties. Copyright © 2019 The Institute of Electronics, Information and Communication Engineers"

Using the alternating least squares method, we attempt parameter estimation for the model with an inseparable parameter group generated by expressing ""regional characteristics of climate"" and ""regional homogeneity of demand"" together as a product of mutually independent factors (meteorological and regional factors).

It is found that the signal of the detector with a plastic scintillator depends on the reactivity and is proportional to the change in the density of thermalized neutrons in the reactor converter.

Here, we present an extension of the natural gradient descent to complex-valued neural networks. Our idea is to use the Hermitian extension of the Fisher information matrix. Moreover, we generalize the projected natural gradient (PRONG), which is a fast natural gradient descent algorithm, to complex-valued neural networks. We also consider the advantage of complex-valued neural networks over real-valued neural networks. A useful property of complex numbers in the complex plane is that the rotation is simply expressed by the multiplication. By focusing on this property, we construct the output function of complex-valued neural networks, which is invariant even if the input is changed to its rotated value. Then, our complex-valued neural network can learn rotated data without data augmentation. Finally, through simulation of online character recognition, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Although lots of algorithms have been proposed continuously, speed and accuracy cannot conform to actual needs, which has always been the focus topic. In this paper, we propose an Improved Marching Cubes algorithm (I-MC) based on the surface rendering theory, which implements 3D reconstruction of the vertebrae. Firstly, we preprocessed the original 2D vertebrae CT images with the bilateral-filter denoising algorithm. Secondly, on the basis of the traditional Marching Cubes algorithm, the seed voxels were extracted and the Region Growing algorithm was used to determine all voxels that contain isosurfaces. Then, the Golden Section instead of the traditional linear interpolation was used to calculate the equivalent point, and this method reduced the calculations of public edges. VTK and OpenGL implemented 3D reconstruction of the vertebrae on GPU quickly and accurately. The experimental results show that when compared with the traditional Marching Cubes algorithm and Mesh Simplification Marching Cubes algorithm, the improved algorithm achieves a significant improvement of reconstruction speed while preserving the accurate results. The efficiency of algorithm is improved dramatically. This method is real-time and achieves the goal of efficient 3D reconstruction of vertebrae CT images. © 2019, The Editorial Department of Journal of Harbin Institute of Technology.

Although there have been many studies on the Imjin War by Korean and international scholars on the topics of diplomatic exchanges and military engagements during the conflict, they are comparatively few studies in English language scholarship concerning the war's impact on social integrity and group consciousness. The Godae illok written by a yangban Righteous Army member, Jeong Gyeong-un, documents his personal activities throughout the war, his interactions with members of the Ming Chinese forces, and views on a Joseon society besieged by the Japanese. Some scholars are quick to claim that this invasion became the new foundation of social and group consciousness in Joseon. However, a reading and analysis of passages in Jeong's diary would indicate that social consciousness based on the pre-Imjin War period was the foundation of group thought during the war, as many men went into battle with the aspiration of attaining lucrative positions in a government founded on ideals and philosophies predating the invasion. © 2019 by the Academy of Korean Studies."

This study analyzes the functional relevance of certain polymorphisms of the SOST promoter region, and their relationship with the expression and methylation of this gene. Material and methods: Alleles of the rs851054, rs851056, rs10534024, rs1234612 polymorphisms and DNA methylation were analyzed by pyrosequencing in serum and bone samples of 33 patients undergoing hip replacement. In addition, SOST expression was studied in bone samples. Also, different alleles of the SOST promoter were cloned into double reporter vectors with the luciferase gene under this promoter and the alkaline phosphatase gene under a constitutive promoter. Results: Methylation analysis of the SOST promoter region in serum free DNA and bone DNA revealed no statistically significant differences across the alleles of the analyzed polymorphisms (p>0.05). However, transfections with reporter vectors showed high transcriptional activity, regardless of the vector used. Conclusion: We have not found a clear association between the different alleles and the DNA methylation of the SOST promoter region. Further studies are needed to determine the polymorphisms' functional effects on the methylation and expression of the SOST gene and the consequences on bone mass. © 2019 Sociedad Espanola de Investigacion Osea y del Metabolismo Mineral (SEIOMM).

Perhaps, given the many high-profile cases involving politically-exposed persons pursued by the government, the anti-corruption programme has been more studied from domestic angles. However, analysing the programme from a domestic angle limits an elaborate analysis of the anti-corruption programme given that the government also employs an international approach, through the instrumentality of foreign policy, to achieve its objectives. The paper aims to evaluate the international dimension of the anti-corruption programme in the first term of the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari (2015 to 2019). The article analyses the anti-corruption goals and strategies in foreign policy and further identifies the outcomes of the strategies.

For this reason, neutron area monitors, which legally and periodically require calibration in Korea, are removed from the installation location and tested at the Korea Atomic Energy Research Institute (KAERI) or the Korea Research Institute of Standards and Science (KRISS). To test the possibility of an on-site performance calibration system, the KAERI manufactured a movable neutron irradiator. The movable neutron irradiator is composed of high-density polyethylene and has an overall size of 50 cm (L) × 50 cm (W) × 46 cm (H). In this study, the neutron fields generated by the movable neutron irradiator were quantified at distances of 80, 100, 120, and 140 cm from the centre of the source. Quantification was performed using the initially estimated neutron spectrum from the computer simulation, the count rate data measured using a 6LiI(Eu) scintillator combined with a Bonner sphere spectrometer (BSS), and the response function of the BSS. As a result of the quantification of the neutron field at each distance, the fractions of scattered neutrons to total neutron fluence were almost constant within 5%. © The Author(s) 2019.

Dialogue should aid students in articulating self-awareness (conscious or unconscious) regarding their behaviour and learning habits and the learning process and its results at the same time as assessing their quality and the ways in which they may be improved. One of the reasons behind our increasing inability to break down the inherent barrier between teachers and students is due to a lack of engagement in ongoing dialogical reflection as a means of advancing the teaching-learning process within the school. This article offers a theoretical contribution on dialogue in teacher education through the philosophical concepts of a ten years of teacher education program which was designed according to the principals of Philosophy with Children. The program fostered creativity and self-reflective thinking in teacher education and offered dialogical methods. It is based also on six dimensions that are the basis of Philosophy with Children: learning from a place of questions, community of learning that resists the educational hierarchy that boasts of omniscience, coordinator as a participant in the learning process, learning in the real present, legitimization of improvisation as a way of learning, learning as liberating the learner from disciplinary boundaries. All six dimensions view Philosophy with Children as a pedagogy of searching at whose center lies the pursuit of meaning that facilitates personal development—and thus self-direction and capability. © 2019 State Univ of Rio de Janeiro - Center of Childhood and Philosophy Studies.

The sapping process causes ergonomic hazards leading to aggravating pain and functional disabilities. Muscle strengthening exercises, both non-weight-bearing exercise (NWE) and progressive resistance exercise (PRE), reduce those burdens. However, only muscle strengthening exercise may not be sufficient for the improvement of individual functional ability. Participatory ergonomic approaches (PEAs) were developed and implemented in this study. The objective of this study was to compare the performance-based results among the PRE-PEA, NWE-PEA, and standard treatment (STG) groups in aged para-rubber farmers with KOA. The participants performed self-practice for 8 weeks and recorded compliance daily. The primary outcomes that included the timed up and go test (TUG), 40-meter fast paced walk test (40mFPWT), and stair climb test (SCT) were measured at baseline, 5, and 9 weeks. The results showed that a mean comparison of the 3-paired groups resulted in statistically significant differences in TUG, 40mFPWT, and SCT between the PRE-PEA vs. STG and NWE-PEA vs. STG (p<0.001). PEAs with PRE and NWE could improve functional abilities in both the performance-based and patient-report assessments in aged para rubber farmers with KOA. © 2019 KIIE."

We find that there is an upper limit on $\omega$$, and the vortex configuration should be parametrized by the angular momentum rather than $\omega$$. We also discuss matter modes localized on the vortex. We show that the vortex spin mixes the Kaluza-Klein (KK) masses and induces nonvanishing masses to the zero-modes.

Products containing malt, malt extract, and other gluten-containing ingredients continue to show up on store shelves, which may indicate that FDA enforcement of the GF labeling rule is lacking.

The numerical work is done on the basis of the cylindrical Mie theory. It is shown that for incident light with different polarization, the resulted scattering cross-section spectra will also show different characteristics with varying incident angles. For TE case, resonance splitting is observed due to excitation of a new resonance mode, while for TM case, resonance merging is observed. An interference effect between different resonance modes due to variation of incident angle is then resulted in suppression of backward scattering intensity for TM case. Meanwhile, for TE case, at illumination angle approaching grazing angle, a spectral range exists whereby the scattered wave's angular intensity profile forms a perpendicular dipolar feature with different polarization. The reported results may be useful for aplication of nanoantenna, photovoltaic, and polarization conversion. © 2019 World Scientific Publishing Company."

Unlike previous work which ignores the mechanism of answerable and unanswerable, the semantic conflicts detection-based MRC network (SCDNet) was proposed aiming at detections of no-answer (NA) questions through semantic conflicts detection network. The basic idea is that if the given question is unanswerable, there exists semantic absence or conflicts between the question and the reference passages. Therefore, SCDNet predicts the NA probability by checking whether the passage covers the integral semantics of the question. Besides, in order to extract the exact answer from the passage, SCDNet is applied an answer length penalty in the loss function, which helps the learning objective to be more consistent with the evaluation metrics. SCDNet packs the NA question predictor and the answer extractor in a joint model and is trained in an end-to-end manner. Experiments show that SCDNet performs better than some strong baseline models, and achieve an F1 score of 72.43 and 76.96 NA accuracy on SQuAD 2.0 dataset. © 2019, Editorial Department of Journal of Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications.

By combining in-situ SEM and digital image processing (DIP), the damage evolution process and damage characteristic parameters of each stage were obtained. The experimental results indicate that the hydration and dissolution of minerals can not be a determinant factor in structure damage. The micro-structural damage is due to disintegration of mineral aggregates, leading to changes in the number and size of cracks and pores. The damage degree of specimens is related to its initial structure, and the micro-structural damage intensifies and finally tends to stabilize with cycle times increased. © 2019, Wuhan University of Technology and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, Part of Springer Nature."

Our focus was whether and how online mass media construct public awareness in response to the impact of climate change on human health. Methods: We developed a search strategy consisting of three progressively more delimited phases. First, we searched major publication for articles in online mass media in Indonesia published from 2009 to 2014. The list of online media was provided by the National Library of Indonesia. Second, we selected articles employing general and specific set of criteria. Lastly, we coded the selected articles to track article characteristics and identify common themes. Climate change articles with a human health focus were included. A media content analysis was applied to guide the interpretation of the data. Results: We identified that online media have limited information around the impact of climate change on human health. News reporting of climate change impact on human health has constructed uncertainty around the issue that led to disengagement in relation to possible changes in public behaviors in particular the adaptation and mitigation efforts. Moreover, the communication of climate change from scientists and policy-makers to the public via the online mass media has been a subject of major interest because of its implications for creating public awareness of a climate change impact issue on public health. Conclusions: Online mass media might help in the development of better informed public debate about climate change issue.

ISS then simulates inundation and transforms the simulated results into spatial information. The results can be shown on the web using MapServer, web GIS technology. The process of simulation is simplified by running 2DIM automatically instead of manually. Luzhou and Sanchong Districts in New Taipei City are selected in this research to test the ISS during system development and test phases. ISS chooses a single rainfall event for each case to simulate inundation, and transforms the simulated results to spatial information. The simulated results are compared with those simulated manually in a step by step approach, and then ISS displays the simulated results using ArcGIS software. Results show that that ISS is feasible and can be applied to execute 2DIM, and to display geospatial data online.

METHODS: In between January 1985 and August 2016, a total of 1238 patients, who presented with a diverse set of clinical situations and had implanted a single or double chamber pacemaker were retrospectively included in the present study. Age, prior history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, heart failure and coronary artery disease did not differ between the groups (P>0.05). RESULTS: When pre-implantation echocardiographic data was compared to the post-implantation values, in both groups, there were a significant decrease in LVEF (P<0.001) and increase in LVEDD (P<0.001), LA size (P<0.001) and sPAP (P<0.008). RESULTS: When the patients who had a pacemaker due to a complete AV block were analysed, regardless of having VDD or DDD pacemaker, a significant decrease in LVEF was observed (P<0.0001). When the current rhythm at the last visit was evaluated, we found that patients with VDD were mostly in sinus rhythm (P<0.001). During the long-term follow-up, pacemaker-related complications (tamponade, infection, and pneumothorax) did not differ between the two groups (P>0.05). The comparison of the two pacemaker groups according to the decline in LVEF (≤% 40) did not show any significant difference (P=0.122). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with VDD or DDD pacemakers have both a decline in LVEF and an increase in LV diameter during the long-term follow-up. Mortality and complication rates were not different between the two groups.

We retrospectively investigated walking outcomes at 3 months after starting gait training with a prosthesis. Forty-four unilateral transtibial amputees with (n=18) and without diabetes (n=26) were included. At 3 months after gait training with a prosthesis, only 2/18 (11.1%) and 3/18 (16.7%) diabetic amputees were capable of independent outdoor and indoor walking without cane, respectively. However, 21/26 (80.8%) and 24/26 (92.3%) non-diabetic amputees were capable of independent outdoor and indoor walking without cane, respectively. With assistance of cane, most of non-diabetic amputees (n=24, 92.3%) were capable of walking in both outdoor and indoor but only seven (38.9%) and nine (50.0%) diabetic amputees were capable, respectively. Thus, short-term walking outcome were poor in transtibial amputee with diabetes compare to those without diabetes, and these results suggest intensive rehabilitation would be needed to them. © 2019 Tehran University of Medical Sciences.

"The Effect of Light-Element Impurity Atoms on Grain Boundary Diffusion in FCC Metals: A Molecular Dynamics Simulation","2019","Steel in Translation","0","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85083974927&doi=10.3103%2fS096709121912009X&partnerID=40&md5=67ab5db11fa40dc2dfd836a446b30b09","Abstract: The effect of carbon and oxygen impurity atoms on diffusion along the tilt grain boundaries with 〈100〉 and 〈111〉 misorientation axis in metals with FCC lattice was studied by the molecular dynamics method. Ni, Ag, and Al were considered as metals. Metal atom interaction was described by many particle Clery-Rosato potentials constructed within the framework of tight binding model. To describe interactions of light-element impurity atoms with metal atoms and impurity atoms, Morse pair potentials were used. According to obtained results, impurities in most cases lead to an increase in self-diffusion coefficient along the grain boundaries, which is caused by crystal lattice deformation near the impurity atoms. Therefore, additional distortions and free volume are formed along the boundaries, which is more expressed for carbon impurities. Moreover, with an increase in carbon concentration in the metal, an increase in coefficient of grain-boundary self-diffusion was observed first, and then followed by a decrease. This behavior is explained by aggregate formation of carbon atoms at grain boundary, which leads to partial blocking of the boundary. Oxygen atoms had smaller effect on diffusion along the grain boundaries, which is apparently explained by the absence of aggregates and lesser deformation of crystal lattice forming around impurity. The greatest impurity effect on self-diffusion along the grain boundaries among the examined metals was observed for nickel. Nickel has the smallest lattice parameter, and impurity atoms deform its lattice around itself more than aluminum and silver. Therefore, they create relatively more lattice distortions in it and additional free volume along the grain boundaries, which lead to an increase in diffusion permeability. Diffusion coefficients along the high-angle boundaries with misorientation angle of 30° turned out to be approximately two times higher than along low-angle boundaries with a misorientation angle of 7°. Diffusion along the 〈100〉 grain boundaries flowed more intensively than along the 〈111〉 boundaries. © 2019, Allerton Press, Inc."

Our study aims to look at the factors which appear to contribute to the effectiveness of collaborative problem-solving efforts in case studies of environmental conflicts in Romania. The selected case studies illustrate conflicts over the management of natural resources, human-wildlife conflicts, as well as conflicts between development and conservation. A framework for collaborative governance and the multi-value qualitative comparative analysis (mvQCA) method are used to assess and compare 27 case studies in order to identify the factors that bring about success in the resolution of the conflicts in question. Our results indicate that a combination of different characteristics of shared motivation and joint action is sufficient for reaching agreement on the contested issues. However, most of the agreements are not stable due to political and administrative reasons. This study discusses the opportunities and constraints under which collaborative efforts unfold in the case studies. It could also help managers to enhance collaboration in the resolution process for environmental conflicts in the future. © 2019 by the authors."

In doing so, we reviewed the literature on experimental tests of procedures for training insight problem solving. The results revealed that most procedures focused either on restructuring or divergent thinking, and provided some evidence for the effectiveness of both approaches. However, we found no studies that compared the effects of the two approaches. The article reports two experiments that compared different training procedures based on restructuring and divergent thinking. For the latter, the methods focused separately on fluency, flexibility and originality training. The first experiment compared a restructuring approach with fluency training and a placebo control condition. The results indicated that the restructuring training was significantly more effective than the others, but only when instructions were verbal, not in script form. The second experiment compared restructuring training with flexibility, fluency and originality training, all presented in script form, and the results indicated that the restructuring training was significantly more effective than both fluency training and flexibility training.

Materials and Methods: Five hundred forty patients who had experienced intraoral haemorrhage were retrospectively reviewed. The outcome variable was the haemostasis method used, i.e., simple (local compression with gauze) or complex (an alternative method after local compression has failed). Predictor variables were sex, age, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) class, hepatic cirrhosis, bleeding disorder, use of antithrombotic agents, and site/cause of haemorrhage. Results: The mean patient age was 48.9±23.9 years, 53.5% were male, 42.8% were ASA class II or higher, and 23.7% were taking antithrombotic agents. Local compression was used most often (68.1%), followed by local haemostatic agents, sutures, systemic tranexamic acid or blood products, and electrocautery. The most common site of bleeding was the gingiva (91.7%), and the most common cause was tooth extraction (45.7%). Risk factors for needing a complex haemostasis method were use of antithrombotic agents (odds ratio 2.047, P=0.009) and minor oral surgery (excluding extraction and implant procedures; odds ratio 6.081, P=0.001).

It is important to understand these adaptations in fisheries stocks to fully inform fisheries management strategies. With this is mind, sea temperatures are an important cue in timing for many marine species, including sole in the North-East Atlantic Ocean. We used spawning data and modelled sea surface temperature (SST) data from sole subpopulations to examine the possibility of local adaptation of their spawning times to rising temperature. Climate window analysis was used, in a linear mixed model using mean spawning week and SST, to investigate statistically significant differences between subpopulations of sole. There was no evidence of local adaptation to changing temperatures for these subpopulations. This suggests that their spawning-time reaction to changing temperatures is currently due to their subpopulation's mean plasticity. Using climate window analysis and modelled temperature data we have demonstrated a method of examining spawning changes in marine populations along a temperature gradient. Recruitment and spawning success are key elements of fisheries population models which contribute to fisheries management. Further understanding of the influence of temperature on recruitment will help inform future modelling. © 2019 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea 2019. All rights reserved."

Methods: Cardiomyocytes of neonatal rats were cultured in vitro. The survival rate of cardiomyocytes was observed by CCK-8 method. The surface area of myocardial cells and the concentration of intracellular calcium ions were detected by laser confocal microscopy. The activity of Ca2+ ATPase was determined by the enzymatic reaction of broken cells. The expressions of Ca MKII, HDAC, c-Jun, ANP, BNP, β-MHC, Ca N, and NFAT-3 proteins were detected by western blot. The concentration of nitric oxide (NO) and the activity of NOS were determined by colorimetry. Results: Different concentrations of rutin could in-hibit the decrease of survival rate of cardiomyocytes induced by Angiotensin II (Ang II), the increase of the surface area, the increase of the Ca2+ concentration in cardiomyocytes, and the decrease of the activity of Ca2+ ATPase, the increment of the relative expressions of Ca MKII, HDAC, Ca N, and NFAT-3 proteins, and the increase of the relative expressions of c-Jun, ANP, BNP, and β-MHC proteins. The decrease in NO concentration and NOS activity also has been inhibited to a certain degree. Conclusion: Rutin has significant inhibitory and protective effects on Ang II-induced hypertrophic cardiomyocytes, and the mechanism may be related with the release of NO, the regulation of intracellular Ca2+ concentration and Ca2+ ATPase activity, as well as the block of calcium ion-mediated Ca N-NFAT-3 and the Ca MK II-HDAC signal transduction pathways. © 2019 Science Printers and Publishers."

However, substantial local differences exist in the provision of welfare services. This paper examines the factors causing marked regional differences in pension provision in China. The study finds that pension provision is segmented across four regional clusters depending on the level of pension coverage and generosity. The analysis reveals that regional fiscal capacity is the strongest predictor of pension differences across the four clusters which in turn is a consequence of the institutional stickiness from the policy priorities generated through the economic reforms. This path dependent mode of policy making is reflected along the two gauges of preferential policy index and location quotient of regional industrial development. The welfare regionalism in case of pension provision in China is thus explained by the economic regionalism of geographic conditions and local opportunity. © 2019, Institute of China Studies.

During the observation period, the signals collected by the FVMP included both temperature microstructure and two perpendicular components of horizontal velocity shear microstructure of every vertical profile. By analyzing the attitude of the FVMP, the results suggest that the platform satisfies the requirements of stability. Estimation of ocean turbulence with a fast-response thermistor is examined by comparing the energy dissipation rate εT from a FP07 thermistor with ε from a shear probe, both of which are attached to the free-fall microstructure profiler. The power spectrum curves of the observed temperature microstructure signals match well with the theoretical spectrum and the calculated turbulence dissipation rates are 10-8-10-9 W kg-1 approximately. Hence it could be available to estimate ocean turbulence using fast-response thermistors with the FVMP, which extends the possibility to obtain much more turbulence data in deep and wide oceans. © 2020."

In order to identify the target passengers using the new gateway service, this paper proposes a market segmentation approach which incorporates the heterogeneity among passengers in the choice of the air-bridge-air route and explicitly incorporates people's curiosity about the new service. A latent class choice model incorporating passengers' curiosity is developed to identify the market segments of the new gateway service offered by Zhuhai Airport. The model is estimated using the stated preference data collected in 12 Chinese cities. The results indicate that people who have a high level of curiosity and/or are price sensitive prefer to use the new gateway service. Meanwhile, some segment-specific strategies of improving the new gateway service are proposed for the sustainable development of domestic airports which have the desire to cooperate with nearby hubs. © 2019 by the authors."

The APrODiTe study suggested that systolic blood pressure (SBP) values at 7:00 AM and 9:30 PM were associated with the 24-hour mSBP in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). We investigated the association of the SBP values at these time-points with the renal outcomes in patients with diabetic CKD during 1-year follow-up. Methods: Ninety-six patients with diabetic CKD were included at 1-year follow- up. The renal outcomes were an increase in the random urine protein/ creatinine ratio or estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) deterioration, which means a decrease in eGFR ≥5 mL/min/1.73 m2 compared to the baseline values. Results: The baseline SBP values at 7:00 AM, and 9:30 PM, and the 24- hour mSBP were 135.6±24.9 mmHg, 141.7±25.6 mmHg, and 136.4±20.7 mmHg, respectively. The SBP values measured at the same time-points after 1 year were similar to those at baseline. The SBP at 7:00 AM was significantly associated with eGFR deterioration in the univariate and multivariate analyses (odds ratio [OR]: 1.032; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.006- 1.059; p=0.016). The SBP at 7:00AM and 24-hour mSBP did not show a concordant association with sustained proteinuria in the linear and logistic analyses. In the subgroup analysis, the association between the SBP at 7:00 AM and eGFR deterioration persisted in patients with CKD stage 3-5 (OR: 1.041; 95% CI: 1.010-1.073; p=0.010). Conclusion: The SBP at 7:00 AM, in addition to the 24-hour mSBP, is also associated with eGFR deterioration in patients with diabetic CKD, particularly in those with CKD stage 3-5.

However, the pledge of such rights independently of pledging the business premises, although useful, may lead to some difficulties in terms of the nature of this pledge, or the law applicable to its pledge agreements due to its special nature. Based on the brief provisions wherein legislators dealt with the subject of the pledge of these rights in the Guarantee of the Movables Rights Law No. 20 for 2018 and the regulation of Transfer, Mortgage and Seizure of the Trademark No. 55 for 2014, we will raise a question of the extent of this law and regulation empowerment to solve these practical problems which accompany the pledge of these rights. And whether the general rules related to the civil or commercial pledge are sufficient to be applied on such confidential and important rights? To answer the abovementioned questions, this article provides a critical analytical methodology. As a result, the findings of the study indicate that the possessory pledge is not appropriate to the industrial and commercial property rights and the cancellation of the law on Placement of Movable Assets as Security for Debt and being replaced by the Guarantee of the Movables Rights Law removed the industrial and commercial property rights outside the security mortgage. Therefore, regulating the pledge of the industrial and commercial property rights in a special legislation is a must. © 2020 National Taipei University of Technology."

To demonstrate the involvement of the recovery processes in the mechanism for radioprotective action of the T1023 compound in animals, data on the survival of clonogenic bone marrow cells of mice exposed to ionizing radiation are presented. It is shown that the radioprotective effect of this compound can be realized not only at the physicochemical stage of formation of radiation damage due to a decrease in the oxygen content in tissues but also due to the post-radiation cell recovery at the biochemical stage. This is confirmed by the presence of the sigmoid part of the dose-response curve in the region of low doses of ionizing radiation. © 2019, Pleiades Publishing, Inc."

In 2017 as part of an Egypt Exploration Society Fieldwork and Research Grant, excavations were renewed to finalise the understanding of the temple’s construction techniques, and the date of the temple. The foundations were of a casemate design with internal fills of alternating silt and limestone chips. The ceramic evidence from within the construction fills dates its construction from the end of the Ptolemaic to the early Roman Period, and the temple’s superstructure was most likely taken down and the blocks reused in the late Roman Period (fourth to fifth century ce). © The Author(s) 2020."

During the 2016-17 academic year, a refugee speaker series was implemented thorough a collaborative effort between a faith-based university and a same faith-based refugee resettlement programme. In their shared geographical area, these organizations possess long-standing, faith-oriented commitments to rights and services for refugees, making the endeavour viable. Using connected learning (Belenky et al.1997) as theoretical underpinning, researchers collected quantitative and qualitative data to identify and describe the participants' perceived impact from attendance at a refugee speaker event. This information can be useful when considering pedagogy for examining issues confronting refugees, as many Americans struggle with knowledge about refugee experiences and adaptation.

The occurrence of illegal logging in tropical countries has resulted in an extreme climate in the country. As a result, rainwater flows freely and this may result in the flooding of the lower areas of the country. Surakarta is a low area with a high amount of rainfall. Surakarta area is always inundated due to the high shipment of water from Boyolali, Wonogiri and the surrounding area. Geographically, the city of Surakarta is between 110°45'15""-110°45'35"" BT and 7°36'00""-7°56'00"" LS with an area of 44.04 km2. Annual rainfall ranges from 22 mm to 560 mm in average. Thus, there is a need to develop good drainage management and sustainable systems in the country. The lapses in previous research studies were improved using the MASIM (Material Simulation) method. This research model used a simulation software to investigate the process of flooding. This study aims to provide an overview of sustainable drainage arrangements on flood minimization, channel efficiency, potentially flooded area mapping, and solutions to the overflow of water channels. © 2020."

The majority of studies of benthic community in mangrove systems have either focused on the adjacent tidal flats, or areas with high density of pneumatophores without entering within the forest, giving a misleading impression that mangrove infauna community is understood in detail. To fill the knowledge gap we investigated the composition and distribution of benthic taxa across a tidal gradient in two meso-tidal tropical estuarine mangrove forests in north Queensland, Australia. We used a 10-cm corer to sample inside the mangrove forest and on the adjacent tidal flat. Taxonomic composition was vastly different between the tidal flat and the mangrove forest. In fact, although peracarid (e.g. amphipods) characterized the community of tidal flats, they were never recorded within the forest. The contrasting community composition likely denotes contrasting ecological role of the two habitats. In particular, because peracarids are a key component of juvenile fish diets, their absence within the forest probably limits foraging opportunities for many juvenile fish within the forest, while their dominance on adjacent tidal flats suggests that these are likely to be the key feeding areas. © 2019 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea 2019.

Nevertheless, there are not studies that analyze the effect of obesity during the entire period comprised between childhood and adolescence. The objective of this study was to determine the differences in postural control between normal-weight and overweight/obese participants during early and middle childhood and adolescence. Methods: 359 children were divided into six groups according to age and weight status. Each participant carried out one 30-s trial with eyes open (EO) and one 30-s trial with eyes closed (EC). Center of pressure signals were acquired using a Wii Balance Board. Mean velocity in antero-posterior (MVAP) and medio-lateral (MVML) directions and the 95% confidence interval ellipse area were calculated. Results: A Mann Whitney U-test showed significant differences between normal-weight and obese 8- to 12-year-old children in MVAP and MVML in both EO and EC. In 13- to 17-year-old adolescents, there were differences between normal-weight and overweight/obese in ellipse area and MVML, both in EO and EC condition. There were no differences in postural stability between normal-weight and overweight/ obese 4- to 7-year-old children.

Thirteen parameters were tested from raw water collected four sampling points. The physicochemical parameters were measured using Hanna multiparametric meter. The concentrations of the metals were determined in triplicates. Flame atomic absorption spectrometer was used in the analysis as well as descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation) and standard error. The Nigerian Induitrial Standard (NIS) and World Health Origination (WHO) guidelines for domestic water were used to compare the rerults of the water from the lake. The study reveals that the mean turbidity ranged between 21.6 - 24.2-NTU and is above the recommended limits of both WHO and NIS. The range of pH was between 6.3 and 8.8. pH is within the neutral range. The study reveals that the mean value of TDS and electrical conductivity is below the recommended limit of both WHO and NIS guidelines. The study shows that there is a high concentration of some heavy metals (Cd, Cu, Ni, Mn, Zn, and Fe) in Jaba Lake. Cd, Zn, Fe, and Ni are above the permissible limits of the NIS and WHO guideline, which is an in dication of pollution.

In this paper, the case of primitive groups with a simple socle of orthogonal Lie type and nonparabolic point stabilizer is considered. Let G be a finite group, and let M1 and M2 be distinct conjugate maximal subgroups of G. For any i ∈ ℕ, we define inductively subgroups (M1, M2)i and (M2, M1)i of M1 ∩ M2, which will be called the ith mutual cores of M1 with respect to M2 and of M2 with respect to M1, respectively. Put $${\left({{M_1},\,{M_2}} \right)^1} = {\left({{M_1} \cap {M_2}} \right)_{{M_1}}}$$ and $${\left({{M_2},\,{M_1}} \right)^1} = {\left({{M_1} \cap {M_2}} \right)_{{M_2}}}$$. For i ∈ ℕ, assuming that (M1, M2)i and (M2, M1)i are already defined, put $${\left({{M_1},{M_2}} \right)^{i + 1}} = {\left({{{\left({{M_1},\,{M_2}} \right)}^i} \cap {{\left({{M_2},{M_1}} \right)}^i}} \right)_{{M_1}}}$$ and $${\left({{M_2},{M_1}} \right)^{i + 1}} = {\left({{{\left({{M_1},\,{M_2}} \right)}^i} \cap {{\left({{M_2},{M_1}} \right)}^i}} \right)_{M2}}$$. We are interested in the case where (M1)G = (M2)G = 1 and 1 < ∣(M1, M2)2 ∣ ≤ ∣(M2, M1)2∣. The set of all such triples (G, M1, M2) is denoted by Π.

The types of violence for children include physical violence, sexual violence, emotional violence, medical abuse and neglect.Sexual violence includes violence that occurs because of an element of forced sexual will or results in actions by perpetrators who are unwanted and offensive to the victim.In dealing with sexual violence in children, parents must have knowledge, be more open and informative to children, especially sexual education in order to provide maximum assistance so as to prevent children from sexual abuse.The community has a very strong contribution in efforts to prevent sexual violence for children. Method: The population in this study was the dasawisma group from Sleman Yogyakarta Regency which amounted to 112 people.The sample size was 66 people or as many as 33 respondents for each village community group (SidorejoVillage, GodeanSub-District) or the people of the city (Nogotirto Village, Gamping District). The purpose of this study is to know the differences of knowledge level and participation of rural and urban communities in preventing sexual violence in children. Result: The results of this study indicate the knowledge and participation of villagers in preventing sexual violence for children with a significance value of 0.011 while in the urban community the significance value is 0.001. The significance value is less than 5% or 0.05, so it can be stated that the level of knowledge influences a person to participate in preventing sexual violence for children.Conclusion: there are differences in the level of knowledge and participation of rural and urban communities in preventing sexual violence for children. © Annals of Tropical Medicine & Public Health."

After demonstrating the answer is not straightforwardly found in the legal text we turn our attention to other aspects which can have an impact on the matter. We build up our case by considering four different levels. At the first level we ask whether the concepts used in the legal definition of 'communication' allow for the inclusion of M2M. At the second level we involve the history of the ePrivacy Directive in the discussion. At the third level the values behind the confidentiality principle come into play. Lastly at the fourth level we look at the issue from a practical stance. The resulting picture points towards the inclusion of M2M in the scope of the confidentiality principle. © 2019 The Author(s) (2019). Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.

The essay introduces ongoing work on a new data model for text called 'TAG' (Text-as-Graph) and its reference implementation 'Alexandria'. The essay outlines how TAG, based on a hypergraph for text, can improve the modeling of complex literary texts, and how Alexandria supports the exchange of markup files in a way that sustains scholarly discourse. We discuss three components of TAG: first, the markup technology stack allows for the formal definition of the meaning of markup ('markup semantics'); secondly, users can add multiple layers of markup that each represent an alternative perspective on text; and finally the editorial workflow is set up in a git-like distributed version management system. As a result, the TAG model provides for the synthesis of dispersed scholarly practices and the advancement of academic discourse. © 2019 The Author(s) 2019.

The article seeks to illuminate those key components that have potentially gone into framing China’s geopsychology over the past centuries and its impact on Beijing’s foreign policy behaviour. Paradoxically enough, China on the one hand talks of anti-hegemonism but it practices hegemonism while dealing with its own neighbours and peripheries on the other. There are several examples that show China’s bellicose postures in affirming its position as an unchallenged regional hegemon, while being psychologically unprepared to tolerate intervention by extra-regional powers, for instance, in the South China and the East China Sea. Fired by nationalism and the historical ambition to rule the roost, China is determined to become a regional hegemon regardless of US attempts to encircle it through the balancing coalitions. Also, China is firm to change the rules of the game in pursuit of advancing and calcifying its core national interests.

To make blast-furnace smelting more efficient, it is necessary to use the metallized product made by regenerative siderite ore roasting. The technology developed for this roasting allows producing metallized concentrate with a Fe content of 65–68%. The main provisions of regenerative siderite ore roasting in shaft furnaces are formulated, and the three-zone shaft furnace design proposed for implementing this process. The thermal and consumption parameters of the process are provided as well as the lean gas circuit of regenerative ore roasting. This circuit allows significant cutting the expenses.

"Turbidity current plunge mechanism analysis and simulation system application","2019","Taiwan Water Conservancy","1","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85083374717&partnerID=40&md5=dc507ac9805fdc54229ee7960c13d195","In recent years, sediment flows into reservoirs with frequent flooding, due to extreme weather and torrential rainfall in reservoir catchments. High gradient slopes and large flow velocities in watersheds also increase inflow sediment yield into reservoirs. Therefore, reservoir sedimentation seriously affects water resources allocation, while maintaining reservoir capacity is a current vital issue. Turbidity current venting is the main method used in Taiwan hydraulic desiltation strategies. The Shihmen reservoir is selected as a research area in this study because it has completed measurement data. Based on field measured data of vertical velocity and sediment concentration distribution, the turbidity current performance is confirmed in the field by behavior calibration. We adapt a Densimetric Froude number and a theoretical equation to estimate plunge point locations during typhoon events. According to the sediment concentrations derived from the regression relationship between discharge and sediment yield, and measured data, the plunge point locations are calculated with differences in plunge point areas. In addition, based on water color differences at plunge point locations, and woody debris aggregation spots, the Densimetric Froude number of the Tsengwen reservoir and Shihmen reservoir are determined to be 0.68 and 0.64, respectively. This study also developed a display and simulation system to analyze turbidity current movement. The system applies the discharge and sediment yield regression relationship, and the Densimetric Froude number estimation formula, to estimate plunge point location and turbidity current movement. The head velocity and arrival time can be predicted in advance for turbidity current venting. Immediate data on reservoir desiltation can provide useful information especially applicable to the Amouping desilting tunnel and Dawanping desilting tunnel. Future studies that incorporate rainfall runoff prediction for turbidity current movement prediction will improve Shihmen reservoir desiltation operations. © 2019."

Therefore, in this paper, shear thickening fluid-enhanced polyurethane foams were synthesized to resolve such problems. Because hydroxyl groups can form hydrogen bonds with some polar molecules, several layers of molecules in PEG-400 can be adsorbed on the surface of silica nanoparticles. The silica nanoparticles could be dispersed in that polymer matrix very well and surface energy of silica nanoparticles decreases. The comparative study of polyurethane foam (PUF) composites based on shear thickening fluid (STF) had been reported. A wt%-dependent SEM analysis was carried out to understand the effects of STF on the cell morphologies of STF PUF. The linear viscoelastic properties of polymer matrix with STF was characterized by parallel plate rheometer. Finally, the mechanical properties were investigated.

We analyzed the outcomes of EVAR in a Jordanian population. Materials and Methods: We conducted a retrospective review of the medical records of patients with infrarenal AAA who were treated with elective EVAR between January 2004 and January 2017 at a single center in Jordan. Patient characteristics, anatomical characteristics, procedural details, and early and late postoperative outcomes were analyzed. Results: A total of 288 patients (mean age, 70 years; 77.8% males) underwent EVAR for infrarenal AAA (median aneurysm size, 64 mm). Bifurcated endografts were used in 265 patients, and aorto-uni-iliac devices were used in 22 patients. Successful endograft deployment was achieved in all patients with no open conversion. Early complications included localized groin hematoma in 15, femoral artery dissection in 4, wound infection in 3, and seroma in 3 patients. With a mean follow-up of 60 months, 50 endoleaks were detected, including 9 type I, 38 type II, and 3 type III. Seven patients had unilateral graft limb occlusion. The 30-day mortality was 1.7%, and long-term mortality was 7.0%, mostly due to non-AAA-related causes. Conclusion: EVAR was safely performed in Jordanian patients with minimal complications. However, long-term surveillance is important due to the risk of endoleaks and consequent intervention. Copyright © 2019, The Korean Society for Vascular Surgery"

The EXAFS signals of the bimetallic systems showed changes in the Cu2+ coordination as a result of their reduction at 150◦C, which doesn't happen to CuCLI monometallic one. The presence of silver facilitates the reduction of Cu2+ in bimetallic systems forming only clusters. At higher reduction temperature (450◦C) all mono- and bi-metallic samples exhibit mainly metallic particles of Cu and Ag with higher aggregation. These results are confirmed by HR-XRD studies.

We focus on conceptual metaphors (Lakoff and Johnson, 1980) and their binary source-target structure, where the source domain reveals the underlying conceptual knowledge structures of the speaker. This research focus is justified by the omnipresence of political abstract nouns and by the consistency of metaphors - in particular, genitive metaphor constructions - within the corpus. We first annotate parts of our corpus for such metaphors. Then, additional genitive metaphors are automatically extracted using an adapted metaphor detection system. Finally, we use a clustering algorithm to group the metaphors by source domain. In the following manual cluster analysis, we show that conceptual metaphors are being used throughout the corpus in a systematic way to implicitly categorize and assess the Arab Spring. © 2018 The Author(s) 2018.

The off-diagonal correlation functions including the tensor current (namely, the scalar-tensor and pseudoscalar-tensor) are calculated in addition to the correlators of scalar, pseudoscalar, vector, and axial-vector fermionic currents. The tensor fermionic current is a part of the Pauli term in the Lagrangian, which is responsible for the electromagnetic interaction of the fermion through an anomalous magnetic moment. In particular, if we take this interaction into account, we modify the frequency of axion-photon oscillations. In the future, it is planned to investigate this feature in details. © 2019, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd."

After the airstrikes conducted by the US, the UK, and France against Syria in April 2018, which took place in reaction to unprecedented usage of chemical weapons against civilian population by regime of Bashar Asad, some States and part of scholars argued that this permissive rule (exception) has already crystalized and humanitarian intervention became part of international law. The aim of this article is to assess whether these opinions are relevant or whether they are simply premature. The text is divided into three parts. Firstly, legality of humanitarian intervention is considered in the framework of the UN Charter and customary international law on the use of force based on evaluation of scholarly debates and the most prominent examples of State practice before 2018. Then, the article describes methodology that is employed in relation to the creation (modification) of customary international law in general and peremptory norm concerning the prohibition on the use of force in particular. This part analyzes how possible normative changes of jus ad bellum should be assessed. The third part evaluates justifications and reactions of States with respect to the use of force against Syria in April 2018 that were presented by the international community of States. The article concludes that the concept of humanitarian intervention remains still illegal even after the airstrikes against Syria from 2018, what conforms to the prevailing opinion presented in contemporary scholarly literature. Even though the positive echoes identified in State practice (and doctrine) are yet premature, they indicate that process of gradual normative change has already been triggered. At the same time, the expectations concerning crystallization of a new possible exception to the general prohibition on the use of force should not be too exaggerated. © 2019 Ondřej Svaček, published by Sciendo 2019."

Both factors cause similar changes in neurological symptoms and neuromorphological effects. Ethanol before irradiation did not significantly modify the state of neurons, but caused the appearance of synapses degenerating via filament type. After irradiation, ethanol at the threshold dose did not change and at a large tranquilizing dose slightly increased radiation changes in neurons and synapses. The effects of radio-modification depended on the dose of ethanol and the time of its administration. © 2019, Pleiades Publishing, Inc."

The strength characteristics of the deposited samples are better than those of rolled ones obtained in the traditional way. The material strength is reduced and its plasticity is increased with the growth of the laser radiation power during deposition. The obtained regularities are explained by analysis of the microstructure. It is found that the hardness of the cladding is substantially higher than that of the substrate material with the corresponding composition. This is a consequence of hardening of each layer during deposition of the next layer and formation of nanosized spherical inclusions representing oxides of metals that make up the powder in the sample bulk. The density of these particles affects the overall hardness of the material and depends on the radiation power supplied. Individual properties of the material for various applications can be modified by appropriate selection of technological parameters of the printing process. © 2019, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd."

In this model, two subsystems were identified: (1) subsystem of heating the particles of coal dust and volatiles released in the combustion zone; (2) subsystem of heat exchange and combustion processes in the tuyere. A two-dimensional velocity field of gas in the combustion zone was investigated. The combustion processes are considered as a set of simultaneously developing phenomena of coke burning in a layer, single pieces of coke and particles of coal dust. The model includes the following equations: total gas mass balance, gas component mass balance, gas heat balance, movement of coal dust particles, and heat balance of coal dust particles. The model calculates maximum burning temperature in the combustion zone, the distance from the cut of the tuyere to the focus of combustion, the length of the oxygen combustion zone, gas temperature, the content of gas phase components, and the degree of carbon burnout of pulverized coal at the outlet of the tuyere combustion zone. An information-modeling system has been developed. It allows for the investigation of the influence of combined blast characteristics, the properties of coke and coal-dust fuel, the geometric dimensions of tuyeres, and other factors on the temperature fields and concentrations of components of the gas phase in the combustion zone. The model also helps to select a rational mode of pulverized coal that will ensure completeness of its combustion in the tuyere combustion zone. The main functions of the program are as follows: representation of results of calculation in form of tables and diagrams, storage of options of basic data in a database, and export of results of calculation to Microsoft Excel. Conclusions were made on the reduction of the combustion temperature in the combustion zone and the approach of the focus of combustion to the tuyere when pulverized coal was injected. The authors also have established the need to use coals with certain quality characteristics and place where coal dust was introduced into the blast stream. © 2019, Allerton Press, Inc."

The facility was developed at the Petersburg Nuclear Physics Institute (PNPI) of the National Research Center Kurchatov Institute in collaboration with the Institute of Space Device Engineering, a branch of JSC (Joint Stock Company) United Rocket and Space Corporation. The spallation neutron source of the facility is based on the 1-GeV SC-1000 proton synchrocyclotron at the PNPI. The internal neutron-production lead target produces 10-ns pulses of neutrons with a repetition rate of 45–50 Hz and an average neutron intensity of 3 × 1014 n/s (in the 4σ solid angle). In the irradiation area located at a distance of 36 m from the neutron source, a high-quality collimated neutron beam with a broad energy spectrum of 1–1000 MeV and a neutron flux of 4 × 105 n/(cm2 s) allows conducting accelerated single-event soft error testing of electronic components. In the course of the irradiation, the neutron energy spectrum and intensity and the spatial profile of the beam are controlled using a fission ionization chamber (beam monitor) and a position-sensitive multiwire proportional counter (beam profile meter). The data acquisition system of the ISNP/GNEIS facility utilizes 250 MS/s 12 bit CAEN waveform digitizers for the processing of signals from the monitor and profile meter by the neutron time-of-flight technique. In the report, parameters of the ISNP/GNEIS testing facility are discussed in comparison with analogous world-class facilities, as well as requirements and recommendations of the standards used in this field. © 2019, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd."

The Ryan Report (2009), the official report of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse (CICA), details the systematic abuse of thousands of children from 1936 to 1999 in residential institutions run by religious orders and funded and overseen by the Irish State. Arguably, the sheer size of the Ryan Report-over 1 million words-warrants a new approach that blends close readings to witness its findings, with distant readings that help surface system-wide findings embedded in the Report. Although CICA has been lauded internationally for its work, many have critiqued the narrative form of the Ryan Report, for obfuscating key findings and providing poor systemic, statistical summaries that are crucial to evaluating the political and cultural context in which the abuse took place (Keenan, 2013, Child Sexual Abuse and the Catholic Church: Gender, Power, and Organizational Culture. Oxford University Press). In this article, we concentrate on describing the distant reading methodology we adopted, using machine learning and text-analytic methods and report on what they surfaced from the Report. The contribution of this work is threefold: (i) it shows how text analytics can be used to surface new patterns, summaries and results that were not apparent via close reading, (ii) it demonstrates how machine learning can be used to annotate text by using word embedding to compile domain-specific semantic lexicons for feature extraction and (iii) it demonstrates how digital humanities methods can be applied to an official state inquiry with social justice impact. © 2019 The Author(s) 2019.

The ability to apply the geometric optics approximations is shown for this purpose. Relevant computations using a 3D ROKS-RG programming tool (the Monte Carlo method) are performed for various experimental results on the optical parameters of nano- and microstructures available in the scientific literature. Given that surface roughness exists as a byproduct of etching during the preparation of structures, the theory is found to satisfactorily agree with experiment. Moreover, most of the radiation is absorbed on account of the surface roughness of substrates, which is expected to induce a nonuniform charge carrier distribution over the structure height and may be among the reasons for the insufficiently high efficiency of solar elements with radial p–n geometry. © 2019, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd."

Landless and leading an itinerant lifestyle in the interwar period, these families lived off an assortment of economic activities which combined bear-taming and/or comb-making with contractual agricultural work on large landed estates. In the aftermath of the 1920s land reforms which endowed the local peasantry with land, the Romani families in question provided the main workforce on the large agricultural estates. At odds with their integration into and their participation to local economies, members of these families were deported to Transnistria during WWII as a consequence of decisions taken by the local Police and Gendarmerie. This was so because, from the standpoint of the law enforcement agencies, seasonal work and mobility posed a threat to the enforcement of surveillance. At the outset of communism, deportation survivors became subject to a process of sedentarization. Later on they took up employment in local factories and agricultural farms, which they combined with seasonal mobility. Bringing together anthropological and historical approaches to Roma's mobility and work, this article stresses the Roma's integration into local economies. © 2019 Grafo SpA. All rights reserved."

This plasma is called the solar wind and consists of protons, electrons, and light nuclei. The solar wind pushes the solar magnetic field into interplanetary space to form the interplanetary magnetic field. The interplanetary magnetic field is a dynamical system that depends on the solar cycle and the Sun’s rotation phase. Thus, the Solar System is a natural plasma physics laboratory with an enormous multitude of different effects showing the current state of the system. By recording cosmic-ray fluxes, one can study the behavior of the interplanetary magnetic field and obtain information about processes that occur both on the Sun’s surface and throughout the Solar System. The main short-time variations in cosmic-ray intensity include the 27-day variations and the Forbush decreases. These variations are caused by complex solar plasma structures, which are generated by different processes on the Sun’s surface and propagate through space in a wide range of velocities. Cosmic-ray fluxes recorded with the PAMELA magnetic spectrometer on board the Resurs DK1 satellite in 2006–2016 are used to show some examples of cosmic-ray variations. © 2019, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd."

It is shown that the classical dynamics is fully determined by a single ordinary differential equation which possesses an infinite number of exact solutions. All solutions describe either the solutions describing the full reflection regime at subcritical energies or the black hole formation regime at larger energies. Black hole evaporation effect is taken into account by introduction of a new field mimicking the one-loop conformal anomaly. The semiclassical solutions become nonanalytic and ambiguous. It is proposed to perform analytic continuation of the subcritical solutions describing the full reflection through the complex domain to bypass singularities of real solutions describing collapse. It is supposed that this may lead to the correct saddle point solution saturating the path integral for gravitational scattering amplitude at enough energy for a black hole to form in the classical theory. © 2019, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd."

To model the effect of neutron irradiation, different methods for estimating the rate of point defect generation in a two-component material (SiO2) have been developed. The simulated drain—gate characteristic is shown to agree well with the experimental data obtained at the concentration of hole traps and their capture cross sections lying within the published data for an unirradiated device after exposure to gamma rays from a 60Co gamma source and after irradiation with fast neutrons with an average energy of ∼1 MeV and accompanying gamma rays using a pool-type reactor. © 2019, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd."

To improve the catalytic properties of the foam, it was subjected to complex modification via sulfurizing in sulfur-containing gaseous media and the additional formation of amorphous or crystalline MoSx nanolayers. The foam was sulfidized in hydrogen sulfide or sulfur vapor at a temperature of 400°C. Amorphous MoSx films were produced via pulsed laser deposition from a MoS2 target in an H2S atmosphere. To obtain nanocrystalline catalytic MoSx layers, thin-film Mo precursors were preliminarily applied to the foam pre-sulfurized in sulfur vapor at 400°C. The deposition of precursors was carried out in vacuum at 22°C. After deposition, the foam with precursors was oxidized in air at 600°C. The modified samples were probed via scanning electron microscopy involving microanalysis and Raman spectroscopy. The effect of the precursor layer thickness on the sulfurizing efficiency and phase composition of the modified layers was established. The amorphous layer deposition was found to have a strong impact on only the O2 evolution. The crystalline layers obtained via sulfidizing of Mo-containing precursors exerted influence on both the cathodic and anodic reactions. The hydrogen overvoltage at a current density of 10 mA/cm2 was −160 mV, and the oxygen overvoltage was below 150 mV, which corresponded to the best electrocatalysts on the nickel foam after the volume modification via conventional chemical treatment (hydro- and solvothermal synthesis). © 2019, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd."

Postneonatal infant mortality dropped from 44.3 to 21.1 postneonatal infant deaths per 1000 admissions, while postneonatal under-five mortality fell from 23.1 to 11.8 postneonatal under-five deaths per 1000 admissions. The multivariable interrupted time series analysis indicated that over the long-term the prompt provision of care change category was significantly associated with reduced postneonatal under five mortality (β = -0.0024, 95% CI -0.0051, 0.0003, P < 0.10). Conclusions: The reduced postneonatal under-five mortality achieved in this project gives support to the promotion of quality improvement as a means to achieve health impacts at scale. © The Author(s) 2019.

How to reduce the release of NOx in the combustion of coke has become a major problem to be solved. Adding a certain amount of catalyst to the coke combustion process can not only effectively improve the combustion efficiency of coke but also reduce the NOx emissions. In this paper, CeO2 is used as an inhibitor for coke combustion experiments, micro-sintering experiments and sintering cup experiments, focusing on the effect of CeO2 on NOx emissions during the coke combustion and sintering process. It is found that in the coke combustion reaction the addition of 1 and 2% CeO2 resulted in NOx reduction of 5.6 and 2.5%. The addition of 3% CeO2 resulted in a 2.8% increase in NOx emissions. When the amount of CeO2 added was 2%, the NO reduction rate during the sintering cup test reached 25.3%. At the same time, the addition of 2% CeO2 resulted in little change in the yield of the sinter, and the increase of the drum strength of the sinter. © 2019, Allerton Press, Inc."

An example of an AT4(p, p + 2, r)-graph with p = 2 is provided by the Soicher graph with intersection array {56, 45, 16, 1; 1, 8, 45, 56}. The question of existence of AT4(p, p + 2, r)-graphs with p > 2 is still open. One task in their classification is to describe such graphs of small valency. We investigate the automorphism groups of a hypothetical AT4(7, 9, r)-graph and of its local subgraphs. The local subgraphs of each AT4(7, 9, r)-graph are strongly regular with parameters (711, 70, 5, 7). It is unknown whether a strongly regular graph with these parameters exists. We show that the automorphism group of each AT4(7, 9, r)-graph acts intransitively on its arcs.

The most common regularities in the development of male gametophyte and its sporoderm were revealed. It is shown that the thicker the endexine, the later the intine starts to develop. The formation of tubular intine at the first mitosis of male gametophyte can occur after initiation of the intine, as it is observed in spores with endosporous spore germination in gametophyte. The dehydration of a pollen grain that is expressed in deposition of lipids and starch can start before the maturation of sporoderm that is observed in inaperturate pollen grains. Angiosperms show the broadest possibilities of variability in the sporoderm structure without losing the capacity for reproduction. © 2019, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd."

The main difference between this case and the case of systems with fast and slow variables studied earlier is that the matrix at the fast variables is a multidimensional analog of the second-order Jordan cell with zero eigenvalue and, thus, does not satisfy the standard condition of asymptotic stability. Continuing our previous studies, we consider initial conditions depending on the second small parameter. In the degenerate case, this results in an asymptotic expansion of the solution of a fundamentally different kind. The solvability of the problem is proved. We also construct and justify a complete power asymptotic expansion in the sense of Erdelyi of the optimal time and optimal control in a small parameter at the derivatives in the equations of the systems. © 2019, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd."

In this study, using semi-quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) and real-time PCR techniques (qPCR), TGF-β2 and its receptor type II (TGF-βRII) mRNA levels were examined in mouse endometrium during estrous cycle and in response to an acute exposure of 17β-estradiol (E2) and progesterone (P4). We found that TGF-βRII mRNA was expressed at a very low level during diestrus, and remained comparatively higher at proestrus, estrus and metestrus stages with no significant differences between them. On the contrary, the average TGF-β2 mRNA levels abruptly increased from estrus to diestrus stages and then briskly decreased at proestrus, the proliferative stage of the cycle. These results suggest that both TGF-β2 and its receptor type II are functional during proliferation as well as apoptosis of mice endometrial epithelial and stromal cells. A single injection of E2 or P4 at diestrus stage mice caused significant attenuation of the expression of TGF-β2 mRNA after 8 h of treatment compared to sesame oil control. Inhibition induced by P4 was comparatively stronger than that induced by E2 and results further showed that combined injection of E2 and P4 had similar inhibitory effects as that of P4 alone on TGF-β2 expression. In contrast, expression of TGF-βRII mRNA was not significantly altered by ovarian steroids administered either alone or in combination. Results further demonstrated that in short-term endometrial tissue incubation, p38 MAPK pathway was involved in the steroid-mediated inhibition of TGF-β2 mRNA with no effect on TGF-βRII mRNA. This result suggests that p38 MAPK pathway may be an important regulator of TGF-β2 and TGF-βRII mRNA expression in vitro in diestrus endometrium, in cooperation with ovarian steroids. © 2018, Zoological Society, Kolkata, India."

Conversely, structural maximum-margin approaches, despite their extensive success in supervised and semi-supervised classification, have not raised equivalent attention in the unsupervised case. For this reason, in this paper, we propose a novel approach that extends the maximum-margin Markov networks (M3N) to an unsupervised training framework. The main contributions of our extension are new formulations for the feature map and loss function of M3N that decouple the labels from the measurements and support multiple ground-truth training. Experiments on two challenging segmentation datasets have achieved competitive accuracy and generalization compared to other unsupervised algorithms such as κ-means, EM and unsupervised structural SVM, and comparable performance to a contemporary deep learning-based approach. © 2017 IEEE."

Gonorrhoea (GO) is one of the major infections. The AIDS and STI program has many approaches to tackle and WHO suggests correct and consistent use of condoms programme. However, there are many conditions that can affect the practice of the programme. The aim of this paper was to describe risks factors to GO prevalence among FSW in 3 cities. Method: The data that analyzed originated from cross sectional study of GO resistances and the respondents were 880 FSW chosen by cluster random sampling from Tangerang, Palembang, and East Jakarta in 2012. Endocervical swab were collected from respondents. The Diagnosis of gonorrhea confirmed in accordance with the results of microscopic examination after being given Gram staining, as well as culture on Jembec media to confirm. Demographic and behavioral data were collected through structured questionnaire. Result: The prevalence of GO among respondents was 25.8% (227/880). Demographic characteristics of respondents were mostly at age range 18-63 (96.14%), mostly direct sex worker (82.39%), almost half were Junior High School graduated (42.27%), and 63.75% divorced. Some demographic data related to the highest prevalence of GO were among direct FSW there was 28.4% cases (p=0.001), among FSW younger than 18 old years there was 47.06% cases (p=0.006), among not married and divorced there were 31.75% and 27.99% cases (p=0.001 and p=0.002), and among Junior High School graduated FSW there were 31.18% cases (p=0.012). Relation between behavior and GO were found on sex debut before 17 years old (p=0.024), condom use in the last week (p=0.017), and multi-ways of sex intercourse (p=0.041). Health promotion that was given by pimps and Outreach worker has no strong relation to GO cases. There is possibility of drug resistance that triggered by self-prescribed prophylactic antibiotic use, together with inconsistent condom use has cause high GO prevalence. Conclusion: Risk factors from demographic and behavior ailments still impacting GO cases among FSW. There is urgent need to educate them to protect themselves besides reducing the younger FSW approaching. Although program has been carried out, there is a trend of more unprotective condom use. A comprehensive STIs-HIV prevention program is required. © 2019 Annals of Tropical Medicine & Public Health."

The study has used the ARDL technique to achieve the objectives of the study. The finding revealed the fact that the roles of crime have been well emphasized in the literature, especially on how it acts as a stoppage on the progress of the economy in terms of growth. A crime committed in the economy incurs more expenditure and causes the mobility of highly skilled labour which is worse than the formal labour market. Socioeconomic strains have similar dimensions of impacts on crime variables regarding the positive relationship based on the above results. Deterrence variables performed as expected on other crime variables except on person's crime. Family instability showed a positive impact on property crime. The extent that socioeconomic strain affects crime variables has shown that the strain of frustration, anger and stress in people are exhibited in the social and economic factors that prevail in Thailand. Individuals facing economic hardships brought by socioeconomic factors would innovate alternative means to survive. © 2019 General Jonas Zemaitis Military Academy of Lithuania General Jonas Zemaitis Military Academy of Lithuania 2011."

The effective doses received by the interventional radiology staff after performing 230 FGIs in a year were assessed by using double dosimetry and five various algorithms. The Shapiro–Wilk test revealed normally-distributed data (p < 0.01), while the significant correlation coefficients between the effective doses ranged between 0.88 and 1.00. As for the Bland–Altman analysis, both Niklason and Boetticher algorithms strongly supported the absence of statistical significance between the estimated effective doses. This portrays that the occupational doses received by the interventional radiology staff during FGIs fall within the acceptable limit regardless of the varied algorithms applied. In short, the Niklason and Boetticher algorithms appeared to be the more interchangeable ones for effective evaluation of doses.

As compared to our previous analysis, the reconstruction software is updated and the simulation accuracy of backgrounds is improved. Events taken at low and high LHC luminosity are studied separately. In addition, the kinematics at the later stages of event selection is investigated in detail and systematic uncertainties are fully estimated. It is shown that the Monte Carlo modeling satisfactorily describes the experimental data at different selection stages. Kinematic distributions for hadron jets are studied also in the Z-boson control region, where the acquired data reach the order of ten million events. As compared to the previous investigation, the modeling accuracy of Z and background processes is noticeably improved, and events at low and high LHC luminosities are studied separately. Furthermore, all systematic uncertainties related to jets are estimated as well. As a whole, good agreement between experimental results and Monte Carlo simulation data is observed.

We use an inner-outer iteration procedure to accelerate such convex functions, which considers the accelerated randomized proximal coordinate gradient method as the inner procedure and the accelerated proximal point algorithm as the outer procedure. In order to make a connection between the inner and outer procedures, we enhance the dependence on the condition number and redefine the regularization parameter to improve runtime and convergence rates. We also incorporate the non-smooth regularization term into the inner accelerated procedure. Furthermore, we give a theoretical analysis of the iteration complexity and runtime, which is justified in practical applications. We show that the proposed DASM has better or comparable performance than current state-of-the-art accelerated methods for the ill-conditioned ERM problem. © 2017 IEEE."

The analysis relies on the complete sample of proton-proton collisions recorded by ATLAS in 2015–2016 and pays special attention to variations of hadron-jet kinematic characteristics with the collider luminosity. A dedicated software package within the HWW information medium is developed and implemented for plotting kinematic distributions for correlated jets as functions of the number of collisions per beam crossing and of the number of primary vertices per event. On the whole, mean values of kinematic characteristics are found to follow linear dependences on the luminosity which are adequately reproduced by the simulation. Since the hadron-jet selection criteria are similar for the hypothetical HHB and for the Standard Model Higgs boson (SM H) already discovered at the LHC, the reported analysis is also relevant for experimental studies of the SM H properties. In this paper, we also report on initial results of the new search for the HHB at 13 TeV based on ameliorated event reconstruction algorithms and updated software. No significant differences between the results of the new and previous analyses are revealed. © 2019, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd."

It is based on the Feynman diagram technique in the coordinate representation, in which the transition to the momentum representation is modified in accordance with the existing experimental situation. As a result, the Feynman propagator of particles in the momentum representation changes, while the other Feynman rules remain unchanged. In this approach, wave packets are not used and the initial and final states of particles are described by plane waves, which significantly simplifies the calculations. By example of the decay of an unstable particle and neutrino oscillations, it is shown how the differential probabilities of these processes can be found and that the results obtained agree with the expected ones. © 2019, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd."

It starts from the Cauchy integral formula and the extended Stroh formalism which allows writing the general solution of thermoelastic problems in terms of certain analytic functions. In addition, with the help of it, it is possible to convert the volume integrals included in the equation into contour integrals, which, in turn, will allow the use of the method of boundary elements. For modelling of solids with thin inhomogeneities, a coupling principle for continua of different dimensions is used. Applying the theory of complex variable functions, in particular, Cauchy integral formula and Sokhotski-Plemelj formula, the Somigliana type boundary integral equations are constructed for thermoelastic anisotropic half-space. The obtained integral equations are introduced into the modified boundary element method. A numerical analysis of the influence of boundary conditions on the half-space boundary and relative rigidity of the thin inhomogeneity on the intensity of stresses at the inclusions is carried out. © 2019 Heorhiy Sulym et al., published by Sciendo 2019."

In 2014 in the state of Guerrero, Mexico, the yellowing disease of Roselle (Hybiscus sabdariffa L.) was reported, associated with the begomovirus Okra yellow mosaic Mexico virus (OYMMV). Since then the number of affected plots has increased in the state and a higher number of plants has been observed with mosaic, albinism, discoloring of leaf veins, interveinal chlorosis and yellowing. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to determine whether there are other species of begomovirus in the Roselle crop, under the hypothesis that different symptoms might lead at least to another distinctive Begomovirus species. Roselle plants with yellowing, mosaic and leaf veins discoloration were collected from two plots in Ayutla, and from another one in Tecoanapa, both municipalities in Guerrero state. Collected plants were, 12 with symptoms and three without symptoms. Plants DNA was amplified by rolling circle (RCA) and afterwards by RCP for the detection of begomovirus and of alpha and beta satellites. In Roselle plants with leaf vein clearing, OYMMV was detected, Sida golden mosaic Honduras virus (SGMHV) in plants with chlorotic spots and leaf vein discoloration and Whitefly-associated begomovirus 3 in plants with mosaic, interveinal chlorosis and yellowing. Alpha and beta-satellites were not detected. This is the first report of the SGMHV associated to Roselle and, particularly of the presence of the Whitefly-associated begomovirus 3 in a plant species.

In the message-scattering part of the message-passing interface (MPI) scatter function, data transmissions are ordered according to the proposed linear algorithm, based on the processor status. The MPI hardware unit in the root processing node checks whether each processing node's status is 'free' or 'busy' when an MPI scatter message is received. Then, it first transfers the data to a 'free' processing node, thereby reducing the scattering completion time. In the message-gathering part of the MPI gather function, the data transmissions are ordered according to the proposed linear algorithm, and the gathering is performed. The root node receives data from the processing node that wants to transfer first, and reduces the completion time during the gathering. The experimental results show that the performance of the proposed algorithm increases at a greater rate as the number of processing nodes increases. © 2019 The Korea Institute of Information and Communication Engineering."

This mixture was reacted further with NH4OH, systematically varying reaction conditions and reagent ratios to optimize pyrazine yield. The highest yield of pyrazine was obtained when 1 g of glucose was reacted with 25 mL of buffer at 150-160 °C for 60 min, which in turn was reacted with 1 mL of concentrated aqueous NH4OH at 120-130 °C for 17-18 h. Higher temperatures and higher concentrations of glucose caused a decrease in the yield of pyrazines. The addition of hydrolyzed tobacco-derived F1 protein as a secondary source of nitrogen increased the yield of pyrazines by 2-10% depending on F1 protein concentration. Furthermore, the addition of any α-hydroxyketone, similar in structure to acetol, as a pure reagent to the reaction mixture not only increased the yields of pyrazine by ranging from 25-100 % depending on the reagent concentration, but also significantly altered the qualitative and quantitative distribution of the pyrazines. With all of the reaction parameters examined (reaction time, temperature, reagent ratios, etc.) the most significant impacts on both pyrazine yield and distribution were noted when: 1) glucose was pre-reacted with buffer, 2) hydrolyzed F1 protein was added as a second nitrogen source, and 3) when pure α-hydroxyketones were employed as co-reagents. Use of these reaction parameters was found to dramatically shift the pyrazine distribution toward higher molecular weight resulting in a pyrazine array having more desirable physical and sensory attributes. © 2019 Mehdi Ashraf-Khorassani et al., published by Sciendo 2019."

Giemsa-stained thin blood smears and impression smears prepared monthly from sheep and goats in Al-Dammam, Al-Qatif and Al-Jubail were, examined for the presence of tickborne piroplasms. A total number of 3211 small ruminants (1698 goats, 1513 sheep) were examined for both Babesia and Theileria parasites. The overall prevalence of Babesia infection was (36.56%±4.03) while that of Theileria was (0.06%). Four species of piroplasms were detected in the study area namely Babesia ovis, B. motasi, Theileria ovis and T. lestoquardi. A percentage of 36.04%±4.23 of the examined goats and 37.27%±5.95 of the examined sheep were infected with Babesia. The highest seasonal prevalence of Babesia infection was reported in spring (45.19±4.05) and summer (41.43±6.62), followed by winter (34.02±10.21) and autumn (25.59±8.97). Ticks identified in this study include Rhipicephalus and Hyalomma. Ardi and Janobi breeds of goats are most susceptible, followed by crossbreed and Shami breed. In sheep, Neimi breed is the most susceptible followed by Arabi and crossbreed. Animals over one year of age are more susceptible to infection than those aging less than one year. No significant difference reported in susceptibility to infection between different sexes of both animal species. © 2019."

We developed an isotope dilution gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (ID-GC-MS/MS) method for the detection of 2-nitropropane in mainstream cigarette smoke. The vapor fraction of mainstream cigarette smoke was collected in inert polyvinyl fluoride gas sampling bags and extracted with hexanes containing isotopically labeled internal standard, then purified and concentrated via solid-phase extraction using a normal phase silica adsorbent and a 100% dichloromethane eluant. This method is sensitive enough to measure vapor phase 2-nitro-propane concentrations in the nanogram range, with a 19 ng per cigarette method limit of detection. Product variability estimated from the analysis of 15 cigarette products yielded relative standard deviations ranging from 5.4% to 15.7%, and estimates of precision from two quality control products yielded relative standard deviations of 9.49% and 14.9%. Under the Health Canada Intense smoking regimen, 2-nitropropane in machine-generated mainstream smoke from 15 cigarette products ranged from 98.3 to 363 ng per cigarette. © 2019 Gala M.

Mature DMs are associated with adaptive functioning. Immature and neurotic DMs are associated with maladaptive functioning. Our goal was to determine the intensity of the most frequently used immature, neurotic and mature ego DMs in patients with epilepsy. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We examined 50 patients with epilepsy, using a Defense Style Questionnaire (DSQ-40). We measured the intensity of individual DMs. Mature DMs: sublimation, humour, suppression and anticipation; neurotic DMs: undoing, pseudo-altruism, idealization and reactive formation; and immature DMs: projections, passive aggression, acting out, isolation, devaluation, autistic fantasies, denial, displacement, dissociation, splitting, rationalization and somatization. The control group consisted of 36 healthy subjects. Groups are equal in age and level of education. RESULTS: Patients with epilepsy use neurotic (p=0.0290) and immature (p=0.0155) defensive styles significantly more. Individually, they most intensively use acting out, humour and sublimation, and statistically significantly more they use displacement (p=0.0161), denial (p=0.05) and somatization (p=0.0019). CONCLUSION: Patients with epilepsy use the neurotic and immature styles of ego defence more intensively. As such, they are less adaptable to new situations. Our knowledge can be useful for planning future interventions for people living with epilepsy."

A natural measure of the mirror asymmetry is associated with the Gauss invariant, i.e. the linkage number of vortex and magnetic lines. We consider the relation between magnetic field generation and the knotting of vortex and magnetic lines in terms of hydrodynamic and magnetic helicities. Higher helicity invariants known in topology generalize in various ways the Gauss invariant. We argue that these higher helicities are less important for magnetic field evolution than the classical Gauss invariant. © 2019, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd."

The main characteristics of such diodes is the reverse blocking voltage or the breakdown voltage. The aim of this work is to develop a guard ring topology allowing us to obtain the maximum possible blocking voltage of the diode and definite localization of the breakdown place under the conditions of the standard technological processes and without using new materials or substrates. The topology of the high-voltage part of silicon fast recovery power diodes is developed to obtain the maximum reverse blocking voltage. The calculations are carried out in the TCAD environment in the structure editor of which we included a program for the automatic creation of device models with dimensions of about several millimeters. The arrangement of guard rings is calculated according to the proposed principle allowing us to obtain power diodes with different breakdown voltages. The topology is developed so that the breakdown occurs under the edge of the active region, which guarantees the absence of catastrophic failures of the device. Power fast recovery diodes manufactured according to the proposed topology have the maximum reverse blocking voltage within the range of 3.3–6.7 kV, which indicates the reliability of the calculation methodology. © 2019, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd."

A decrease in the attenuator’s dimensions leads to difficulties in the implementation of low and high attenuations, which requires passing to absorbing elements based on piecewise uniform structures. In this work, topologies of small absorbing elements of the waveguide, coaxial, and microstrip attenuators are proposed to implement a wide range of radio signal power attenuations. They differ from the known elements of attenuators with a two-layer resistive film in terms of their lower temperature stability and sophisticated manufacturing technology. Such attenuation is achieved by using a single-layer resistive film with a central region having a high (cut) or low (conductor) specific resistance. A technique based on the rigorous method of conformal mappings for calculating the proposed absorbing elements is developed. In the considered particular cases, the obtained relations coincide with those known in the literature. Three-dimensional plots of radio signal power attenuation and normalized input resistance as functions of the normalized size of the cut or conductor of the central region are presented. A broad range of possibilities of the control for output parameters of absorbing elements are outlined. The working capacity of the technique is verified by modeling both the equivalent circuit parameters and output parameters of the absorbing elements, namely, input resistance and attenuation, as well as by the analysis of real samples of small add-on absorbing elements of microstrip attenuators with the proposed topologies. The modeling is carried out in the Russian Elcut software package. © 2019, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd."

The variance analysis of the samples of fractal dimension values for natural forested and water objects have revealed no influence of polarization on the values before the speckle filtering; however, after speckle filtering, statistically valid differences have been found in the mean values of some pairs of samples. For sample pairs of the copolarizations VV–HH and cross polarizations HV–VH, a random nature of the differences observed in the mean fractal dimension values has been shown. This conclusion is also true for the Haralick textural features of a water object—the contrast, inverse moment, and entropy. Statistically valid differences in the mean values of the Haralick textural features for urban and water objects have been revealed both before and after speckle filtering. For a forested object, variance analysis shows that the polarization-dependent differences in the mean values of the textural feature samples are statistically unreliable. © 2019, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd."

Flor de Mayo Anita, with the Arabidopsis thaliana defensin gel (pdf1.2) was characterized by its biological effectiveness and agronomic advantage under confined conditions. Releasing this technology into the environment requires an Environmental Risk Assessment (ERA) in order to identify the possible adverse effects that the suggested use of the recombinant technology may have on the environment when evaluating the probability of risk, its severity, and the biosafety measures recommended to reduce possible risks. The problem formulation was established in the earlier manuscript and it gave rise to three operative protection goals related to the adverse effects on pathogenic organisms and non-target organisms, the increase in the competitive capacity of the common bean-pdf1.2, and the gene flow to conventional bean crops and wild relatives. The final evaluation points were defined, and from there, nine risk hypotheses were outlined. The ERA dismissed the possibility of occurrence of any damages caused by the expression of the defensin or neomycin phosphotransferase II proteins on the non-target microorganisms and the development of resistance on target organisms. Likewise, the possibility of an increase in the competitive capacity of the common bean-pdf1.2 was discarded, since it is a highly dependent agricultural system, and finally, the possibility of an introgression of recombinant sequences into conventional crops or wild relatives was defined as an unlikely risk, due to the absence of coincidences in its phenological stages during its environmental release, along with the genetic barriers among wild relatives. The biosafety measures recommended to minimize the possibility of damage consisted in establishing live bean and maize barriers, the phenological lag between the common bean-pdf1.2 and conventional bean; follow-up studies during release such as the characterization of soil microorganisms before, during and after environmental release, as well as the identification of voluntary plants after the harvest. © 2019 Colegio de Postgraduados."

The Gospel text is easily complemented by the Qur'nic descriptions of caravans led by the stars through the night. The Magi who, as we now know, came from Dhofar and offered Jesus ""gold, incense and myrrh"" (in fact, the incense of spring assembly, the incense of autumn assembly and the myrrh) offered the Divine baby what they brought for sale. The Arabian frankincense has a wide range of useful properties, important for the treatment of diseases of the respiratory and digestive systems, skin, etc. It has a strong anti-inflammatory effect, a beneficial effect on the human nervous system... However, these properties are not enough to explain the fact that for millennia people were willing to pay for frankincense huge amounts of money. Meanwhile, a series of the ancient sources report the use of the various types of frankincense primarily in the rites of passage. These sources indicate at least two key ceremonies in which the Arabian frankincense was used-this is the birth of a person and his death. In the opinion of a number of leading specialists, the ""expulsion"" of the foetus from the mother's womb is the main trauma that determines the development of neuroses. Today, a number of specialists consider to be practically proved the influence of the mother's psychological and physical state and her experience during pregnancy and childbirth on the subsequent behaviour of the offspring (at the genetic and hormonal level), not only in the first generation, but also in the future. In the Ancient Middle East leaving of life was also unthinkable without these substances (primarily myrrh). Thus the Gospel story brings to us the age-old medical experience and wisdom. © E.

The model between mechanical components and soil based on the discrete element method was established, and the numerical simulation analysis of rotary tillage soil collection was carried out by EDEM software. Using experimental design method and virtual simulation technology, taking the forward speed, rotational speed and soil depth as the experimental factors, and working power consumption as the experimental indicators, the mathematical model between factors and indicators was established by using virtual single factor test and orthogonal experimental test. The results showed that the primary and secondary factors affecting the power consumption of rotary tillage soil collecting cutter roller were the forward speed, the soil depth and the rotational speed. When the forward speed of rotary tillage soil collecting cutter roller was 0.3 m/s, the rotational speed was 470 r/min and the soil depth was 200 mm, and the power consumption of rotary tillage soil collection was 11.98 kW, the superiority of operation performance was identified.

Owing to non-existence of moving parts that a conventional engine has, TAEs are typically mechanically more efficient and reliable, hence are an important area of research. The thermos-acoustic phenomenon for TAEs is only driven by temperature gradient that induces fluid flow. However, in the previous works related to numerical study of standing wave TAEs, an initial disturbance in the form of pressure gradient has been imposed to generate fluid flow. In this paper, a 2D numerical analysis of a standing wave TAE is performed using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling to capture the pressure fluctuations (without any initial disturbance) with time in the resonator channel in order to assess its thermo-acoustic performance. The results are obtained for pressure variation at specific points and the development of temperature profiles within the resonator. Using the pressure variations, FFT analysis was performed to identify sound pressure levels and resonant frequencies. Also, a sensitivity study has been carried out. The objective is to analyze the pressure wave development under different fluid properties. In this study, equivalent properties of a certain mixture of gases are prescribed to represent a composite working fluid. Two cases are considered i.e. mixture of air and helium and mixture of air and carbon dioxide. The compositions are varied in each case. It is noticed that in He mixtures the onset of pressure wave is quicker than in only air or CO2 mixtures, this due to the higher thermal conductivities. However, when only He is considered there is no pressure wave unlike only air or only CO2 cases due to low molecular weight. Frequency in He mixtures rises as He composition is increased, and the contrary is seen in CO2 mixtures. This is due to the collective consequence of the Cp, thermal conductivity and molecular weight. The study shows how important the thermal properties of the working fluid are for the pressure wave. © 2019 Jordan Journal of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering."

Amongst the cases considered here are earthquakes of Chile Apr. 1, 2014 (M = 8.2) and Apr. 3, 2014 (M = 7.7), New Guinea Apr. 11, 2014 (M = 7.1) and Solomon Islands 13.04.2014 (M = 7.6). The main data source for the study is Global TEC with supplementary inputs from GPS observations taken at Guwahati (26° N, 92° E), an Appleton anomaly crest region. A few EQ events with epicenters in and around this anomaly zone are also taken in the study to focus on the seismic induced density features like Earthquake time Equatorial Anomaly (EEA) and Earthquake time Equatorial Anomaly Crest (EEAC) developed over the belt. Such anomalous modifications in TEC resulting to growths of EEA and EEAC covering Solomon Islands—New Guinea extending up to Chile along the fault lines for more than a month, are significant observations brought out in the paper. The GPS TEC data from Gauhati University are utilized in identifying the epicentre position through anomalous appearance of satellites beyond the Line Of Sight (LOS) observation. Finally, the seasonal role on enhancing the seismic induced E-field coupled by mutual interactive EQ preparatory effects of the three major events as well as in enhancement of EQ time radon emission through fault is invoked in explanation to the anomalous density features. © 2019, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd."

According to the classical Waldmeier rule, there is an anticorrelation between the maximum activity value (amplitude) of cycle A and the duration of its ascending branch Tmax – Tmin, while the correlation between A and the length of the downward branch of the cycle Tmin2 – Tmax is much lower. Following Waldmeier, the moment TV can be entered near the end of the downward branch of the cycle, in which the activity falls within a certain (low) specified level V. The relationship between the length of the corresponding phase of cycle TV – Tmax and the amplitude of this cycle is quite strong. We demonstrate that this connection, which can be called the “second Waldmeier rule,” agrees well with the fact that the downward branch of the cycle has a universal appearance. Thus, one parameter, its value is at the maximum, is enough for an approximate qualitative description of the form of a single 11-year cycle that takes into account the two Waldmeier rules. © 2019, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd."

In Morse v. Frederick (2007), the Supreme Court ruled against Joseph Frederick and his “Bong Hits 4 Jesus” banner because Frederick's speech seemed valueless as an adult act, as it lacked any discernible political value. In this essay, Neil Dhingra uses Hannah Arendt's thought to argue that schools should not be interpreted as political spaces but as social spaces where educational authorities should exercise forbearance as students such as Frederick learn to exercise their free speech rights. In particular, students will practice their First Amendment rights by exposing and exploring the discrepancy between appearance and reality, through dark forms of humor, and in forming different types of friendship, all of which schools are unlikely to be able to manage or interpret. Recognizing these unruly and quasi-humorous forms of First Amendment practice helps make sense of Frederick's banner. Dhingra argues that in order to create space for students to develop freely — that is, without being subject to excessive scrutiny or succumbing to the danger of conformity, or both — schools should show a wide but not unlimited tolerance to speech like that of Frederick, which may otherwise be dismissed as childish and valueless “gibberish.”. © 2020 Board of Trustees | University of Illinois"

It is necessary to use the finite element modeling calculation of the frequency response of the membrane module’s membrane due to the complexity of the package design. In this study the method of the thin dielectric membrane modeling by the structural and acoustic analysis in the ANSYS software is proposed. This method allows us to perform the calculation taking into account the influence of the front and back chamber size. The dependences of resonance frequency of the front chamber and back chamber on its geometric sizes are obtained. It is shown that by increasing the back chamber size, the value of the membrane sensitivity approaches its value in the open space. The membrane modules’ frequency response is compared and it shown that the presence of the front and back chambers significantly affects the values of the resonance frequency and sensitivity. The method of setting residual stresses in the membrane using thermal impact is used. A complicatedly deformed state of the membrane, called the buckling effect, is obtained. The dielectric membrane’s sensitivity with allowance for the buckling effect is calculated. The results are analyzed and it is shown that the calculated sensitivity of the membrane taking the buckling effect into account has a good coincidence with the measurement results. The proposed method enables us to calculate the membrane module’s frequency response taking the influence of the package design’s peculiarities into account and also the residual stresses in the membrane. The use of structural-acoustic analysis enables us to achieve more accurate results while calculating the membrane frequency response, which increases the efficiency of designing the acoustic pressure transducers, and ensures achieving the product’s optimal characteristics. © 2019, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd."

This theoretically predicted effect is confirmed with SOHO/MDI data, which have a high spatial and temporal resolution in comparison with ground-based observations. This work confirms the dissipation slowdown effect in small sunspots. It is reported that the nonlinear dissipation phase derived from discrete receiver (charge-coupled device, CCD) data is somewhat flatter and more diffuse than that derived from continuous radiation receiver data (photographic plates). © 2019, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd."

AIM: To explore the therapist's relationship to job, whether that relationship has an effect on their affective status, and to what extent that relationship can lead to the development of tension (anxiety) during the treatment of opiate addicts. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The sample consists of members of the multidisciplinary teams of the Institute for Addiction Disorders of Canton Sarajevo (45 in total), of which 11 are physicians, 26 nurses/medical technicians, 4 psychologists and 4 social workers. Employee Attitude Questionnaire (16 questions examining level of information, feelings of insecurity, fatigue, teamwork and job satisfaction) and EMAS-S which has two subscales (for measuring cognitive worry factor and autonomic-emotional anxiety state factor) were used. RESULTS: From baseline, 32 (71%) of respondents have the opportunity to apply their knowledge and skills at workplace, which is proportional to their job satisfaction, reduction of anxiety and uncertainty. A large proportion of respondents 36 (80%) stated that they felt more responsible in their work compared to the beginning of career, which was followed by a decrease in the score on EMAS cognition and emotion subscale, what reflected positively on work efficiency. The degree of satisfaction at the end of the work day, often and almost always, has 60% of respondents. CONCLUSION: Employees who feel satisfaction at work, who improve their knowledge and work in a team, have a better attitude towards work and less anxiety, and achieve better results when working with addicts."

Stress of the shovel was analyzed and a mechanical model was established according to the working conditions and features of subsoiling. With the dynamics analysis software ANSYS/LS-DYNA, the resistance changes for cutting the soil by the original subsoiler and the bionic subsoiler were analyzed at a subsoiling depth of 250 mm and a forward velocity of 1.25 m/s. Contrast tests of the indoor bin were carried out for the original subsoiler and the bionic subsoiler to obtain the stress comparison for subsoiling. It was concluded that the resistance upon subsoiling increases with the increasing forward velocity, and the stress of the bionic subsoiler was less than that of the original subsoiler. At the same experimental level of factors, the corrugated-shape bionic subsoiler had efficient resistance reduction of 12.77%, proving that the corrugated-shape bionic subsoiler had better performance in resistance reduction and can reduce the total energy consumption. © 2019, Asian Association for Agricultural Engineering.

Zipory suggests that the key component of such a presentist pedagogy is interest and argues that focusing on children's current and possible interests instead of, or at least in addition to, working toward their expected future achievement is both respectful of children as meaning-makers and promising in regard to their autonomy. First, he lays out principles for a presentist pedagogy of interest. Following Harry Frankfurt's work on the concept of care, Zipory suggests that schools should pay attention to the fact that students care about various things in addition to focusing on children's required knowledge and desired behavior. He then shows that being interested in something is a particular form of caring about it, and that this form is closely connected to education and learning. After showing the importance of interests to education, Zipory presents the challenges to incorporating them into a curriculum, and, drawing on P. S. Wilson's work, suggests strategies for coping with these challenges. He concludes by addressing the temporal tension embedded in the word “interest” itself and suggests that, in order to distance education from instrumentalization and commodification, a present-oriented meaning of interest should be adopted. © 2020 Board of Trustees | University of Illinois"

Then, grass mixture was sown on these surface layers. In 2015, selected properties of plant communities growing on different variants of surface layers applied in the reclamation process were assessed. It was assumed that the type of mineral and organic substrates used in the process and their quality were the main factors affecting the long term plant diversity present on different variants of restored surfaces. The aim of this analysis was the assessment of the effectiveness of ash waste reclamation (carried out on five different types of the surface layer) after 12 years since its initiation. The long term results of the reclamation process showed that the applied surface layers allowed for an effective reclamation of ashes since all variants of experimental surfaces were totally covered by dense vegetation. The predominance of plant species from ruderal and segetal habitats indicated that the soil of the experimental habitats was fertile with neutral and slightly alkaline pH, and texture of sandy loams. The experimental surface layers with a texture of sand of favourable C:N ratio, neutral or slightly alkaline did not limit the plant development. The use of organic waste markedly contributed to the floristic diversity of the spontaneously developed vegetation. Coniferous bark used in some experimental variants had a marked effect on their floristic distinctiveness due to the presence of species preferring habitats of lower pH values. © 2019 Polish Academy of Sciences.

During this period sixteen ungulates species were recorded. Among these, eight have shown an increase in numbers during the years 1984-2013, six other decreased, and populations of two other species remained stable. Roan and sable antelope, kudu and warthog were fairly common (with 5-12% of all ungulates recorded). White rhino, black rhino, giraffe, and gemsbok were classified as uncommon (together 11.9%), whilst the remaining eight species were rare (together 1.9%). The eland population showed a weak positive relationship with the annual average rainfall between the years 1981-2013, whereas population sizes of kudu, sable, gemsbok and roan showed a weak negative relationship with the amount of rain. No relationship was detected in giraffe, buffalo and hartebeest populations.

In 2014, 11 persons with de novo induced mosaic deletions and amplifications associated with dicentric and/or ring chromosomes (markers for individual radiosensitivity) were detected. Three years later, the frequency levels of chromosomal aberrations were compared. In 2017 the frequency of aberrant cells had increased by 1.7 times compared to 2014, the frequency of the chromosomal type aberrations had doubled, the frequency of pair fragments had a more than fourfold increase, and the frequency of dicentrics had almost doubled. The mosaic deletion in employee no. 1490 (3q12.3–13.11) identified in 2014 persisted until 2017. Mosaic amplifications identified in 2014 were preserved in five out of six employees (nos. 178, 203, 450, 1620, and 1792). Moreover, we identified that the CNstate in employee no. 450 had increased 1.5 times by 2017. The mosaic amplification of the short arm of the third chromosome in employee no. 278 had been eliminated by 2017. Other changes in the CNA and LOH-genetic landscape were not detected. Thus, these data indicate the formation of self-sustained bone marrow clones, whose descendants produce a population of aberrant cells in the blood of irradiated individuals. Further research into the preservation of chromosomal aberrations and CNA is needed, as well as studies aimed at detecting the clones of aberrant cells in the bone marrow. © 2019, Pleiades Publishing, Inc."

SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Data from the University psychiatric hospital Vrapče, Center for forensic psychiatry on court people sent for psychiatric and forensic evaluation, who were accused of sex offense in two time frames (1998-2001 and 2010-2016) were analysed. In total there were 50 and 57 male subjects sent for an evaluation. RESULTS: In both groups rape was the most prevalent offence, and both groups had the same prevalence of abuse, earlier psychiatric treatment and the majority of offenders were diagnosed with dissocial personality disorder and other personality disorders. Paedophilia was diagnosed in only a minority (14% and 7% respectively) of cases. The latter group (2010-2016) committed more sex offences against children, more often were with no mental disorder and less often had alcohol dependence and mental retardation. Up to one third of the later group were not giving their defence, compared to 4% of the former group. CONCLUSIONS: Changes in court case law and psychiatrists' usage of diagnostic criteria have influenced the prevalent diagnoses in sex offenders. Paraphilias are not often diagnosed in sex offenders because they do not confirm the act, and in recent years more often use not to give their defence (which makes reaching the diagnosis more challenging)."

The possibility of determining the wind direction based on radiometric measurements in two swaths of the radiometer stems from the anisotropy of surface radiation, which is manifested most clearly in the third Stokes parameter. Combining the results of measurements at different frequencies with their reliability factored in, one can improve the accuracy of reconstructing the wind direction. A new algorithm for enhancing the reliability of measurements which takes the real errors in measuring brightness temperatures into account is proposed. The algorithm has been tested with real data provided by the WindSat radiometric system. The results are compared with the Remote Sensing Systems (RSS) reconstruction data. A surface region with different geophysical parameters (sea surface temperature, vapor content, wind speed and direction, and cloud water content) is chosen for this comparison. The reconstruction algorithm involves solving the direct problem of calculating the radio brightness temperatures at linear ±45° polarizations with subsequent calculations of the third Stokes parameter for 37, 18.7, and 10.7 GHz. The initial meteorological parameters for the direct problem are products provided by RSS. The sensitivity of radiometric instruments is taken into account in the simulation process. The solution of the inverse problem and the comparison results demonstrate that this algorithm retrieves the wind direction with fine qualitative agreement both from the results of radiometric observations at a single frequency and from multifrequency data. © 2019, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd."

We have used a method based on the analysis of the ratio of the maximum amplitudes for Sn- and Pn-waves. We have processed more than 200 earthquakes records, recorded by the Kislovodsk station (KIV) at distances of ~200–750 km. It is shown that, in general, the highest attenuation of shear waves is observed in the western part of the region. It is established that increased and intermediate attenuation takes place for paths simultaneously crossing rupture zones of the 1988 Spitak (Mw = 6.8) and 1991 Racha (Mw = 7.0) earthquakes. At the same time, the source zone of the 1970 Dagestan earthquake with Mw = 6.8 is characterized by mainly lower attenuation. These data are consistent with an earlier conclusion that deep-seated fluids have been ascending into the Earth’s crust from the uppermost mantle for a few decades after large seismic events, and this process leads to a decrease in attenuation of Sn-waves. A high attenuation zone has been identified in the western part of the region, where, according to instrumental and historical data, no seismic events with M ≥ 6.0 have been recorded. It is assumed that processes of a large earthquake preparation may be taking place here. © 2019, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd."

Britain applied to join the organisation twice, first in 1963 and then again in 1967, but was rejected by the French president Charles de Gaulle. The rejection seems relevant now since Britain intends to disengage itself from the EU. The cause of rejection, however, was the British close relationship to the United States, which, in de Gaulle's opinion, was a threat to a united Europe. This article also aims to explain the various factors that motivated Britain, which was fundamentally against a united Europe, to join the EEC while knowing that the EEC was based on the concept of a united Europe. Using a historical causal method and a political approach, the writers conclude that while Britain was more or less forced to act by economic issues, de Gaulle's rejection was rather political in nature. © 2019 Universitatea Alexandru Ioan Cuza."

Lower federal courts have struggled to apply the Court's balancing test, reading the same Sell language to impose different requirements. In Sell v. United States, the Supreme Court announced a constitutional standard permitting involuntary medication of mentally ill criminal defendants to render them competent to stand trial. Lower federal courts have struggled to apply the Court's balancing test, reading the same Sell language to impose different requirements. While much ink has been spilled debating whether the Sell standard is sufficiently rights-protective, less attention has been devoted to the state court implementations of Sell. But because many more criminal prosecutions take place in state court than in federal court, it stands to reason that significantly more Sell requests should arise in state court. This Note provides the first comprehensive review of Sell in the states. That review reveals that state courts have largely been forced to choose among conflicting federal approaches to Sell. Therefore, fixing Sell in the states requires assessing those interpretations to determine which one state courts should follow-namely, the approach most faithful to the balance struck by the Sell Court. After making that assessment, this Note proceeds to consider state-specific sources of law as alternative paths to Sell reform. State constitutional law has yet to play a meaningful role in Sell cases and is unlikely to do so in the future. Instead, state legislatures can and should act to give structure to the Sell regime in their states, give guidance to the state courts, and, if desired, create additional protections for defendants. Providing such a comprehensive regime would free state courts from what is essentially a policy decision-picking between the various Sell approaches and determining how Sell should be applied in the states. © 2019 Nick Katz."

We prove that the Wirtinger number of a virtual link equals its virtual bridge number. Since the Wirtinger number is algorithmically computable, it gives a more effective way to calculate an upper bound for the virtual bridge number from a virtual link diagram. As an application, we compute upper bounds for the virtual bridge numbers and the quandle counting invariants of virtual knots with 6 or fewer crossings. In particular, we found new examples of nontrivial virtual bridge number one knots, and by applying Satoh's Tube map to these knots we can obtain nontrivial weakly superslice links. © 2019 World Scientific Publishing Company."

In some cases, however, it is required to determine the characteristics of an analog-to-digital (ADC) system for the incomplete-scale sine wave. A method of measuring static ADC errors for the incomplete-scale input sinusoid, which is a modification of the histogram method for a signal exceeding the full scale, is developed. In the standard histogram method, the overlapping of the range of the input voltages corresponding to the full scale is necessary to ensure the fallout of all possible codes at the ADC output in the presence of gain and zero offset errors. The magnitude of the offset in the standard method is determined based on the number of samples that fall outside the operating range of the ADC. In the proposed method, the conditional overlapping of the range is used to determine static ADC errors. The computation of static ADC errors is reduced to calculating the amplitude of the output signal based on the histogram of advantageous ADC codes. The code transition levels are computed; and the offset and gain errors are determined. The proposed method is tested by modeling in MATLAB. The accuracy of the method is consistent with the expected values of the input errors. The proposed method makes it possible to compute the conversion errors of ADC systems with blocks that limit the amplitude of the input ADC signal. © 2019, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd."

Banana stalks can produce fibers for various purposes; however, banana stalk fiber extraction machines still need improving due to their currently low extraction rate and high impurity rate. Combining the mechanisms used by the organisms’ earthworm and pangolin, a banana stalk fiber extractor with bidirectional rotation features based on bionics was designed, which included a conveying device, a feeding device, a rolling device, a fiber scraping device, a output device, and a fiber collecting drum, etc. After studied the two objects, the bionic designs of rolling roller and blade of scraper were optimized for the anti-adhesion performance of the machine. A three-factor and three-level response surface test was conducted by Design-Expert software, and the optimal combination of parameters for the machine was obtained: rotational speed of the scraper was 1800 m/min, the scraper number was 16 and the height of big tooth of the scraper was 7 mm, and the extraction rate was 92.49% and impurity rate was 21.74%. The study has laid a solid theoretical and technical foundation for the further development of banana stalk fiber extraction machine, and will be of practical significance in promoting sustainable development within tropical rural areas in China. © 2019, Asian Association for Agricultural Engineering.

The calculations were performed with the 1D radiation hydrodynamics code ERA with the laser light absorption model that takes into account stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS), generation of fast electrons in the processes of two-plasmon decay (TPD), and stimulated Raman scattering (SRS). The verification of the developed models was carried out on the basis of the comparison with experiments performed at the OMEGA and NIF facilities. The ignition margin (WQ) of nonuniform fusion targets with an allowance for energy losses due to radiation transfer and heat conduction from the hot spot was the objective of the target optimization. The calculations showed that SBS and target heating by fast electrons generated in TPD and SRS fatally reduce WQ of targets with a CH ablator for the megajoule laser with wavelength λ = 0.53 µm. The possibilities of decreasing these effects by replacing a CH ablator with a glass ablator and reducing the laser intensity upon increasing the target aspect ratio are considered. However, in both cases, WQ remains substantially below unity for the laser with wavelength λ = 0.53 µm. The ignition margin increases by a factor of ∼2 upon transition from the second to the third harmonic of a Nd laser. A glass ablator almost eliminates fast electrons in calculation with the laser wavelength λ = 0.35 µm. In this case, if SBS is reduced by a factor of 3–4 via shifting the laser emission lines in the neighboring channels by Δμ ≈ 10–20 Å, the ignition margin WQ ∼ 2 and a fusion energy yield of ∼50 MJ are obtained in the 1D calculation for a laser energy of ∼2 MJ and the third harmonic of a Nd laser. © 2019, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd."

In this paper, we consider an open-frame analog-digital phase shifter module with a 0°–360° phase change that allows ensuring the accuracy of setting the discrete phase to not more than 0.5° based on the domestic control UHF MIS varicaps. An original L-range analog-digital phase shifter with a 0°–360° phase change using a Lange bridge and phase-shifting cells based on four UHF MIS varicaps is proposed. The requirements for the type of volt-farad characteristic and the capacitance overlap coefficient of the MDP-varicap capacitance are determined. Even at the limiting (critical) UHF MIS-varicap frequency not higher than 15 GHz, the proposed scheme of the analog-digital phase shifter allows ensuring the phase shifter loss that is not greater than 1.5 dB in the L-band. The analog-digital phase shifter with a 0°–360° phase change was operated by the digital control board. An 8-bit DAC was used. The division value of the discrete control of the phase shifter is 1.4° at 256 DAC states. The obtained characteristics of the precision analog-digital phase shifter allow concluding on the propects of its use for solving synchronization problems of an active radio target simulator in testing synthetic aperture radars, as well as in the receiving and transmitting modules of a low-element APAR for the L-band. © 2019, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd."

Therefore, the combination of two or more polymers or metal oxides leads to a polymer with superior properties compared to that of the discrete components. Hence, the present study aims to improve both the electrical properties and the thermal stability of polyaniline through three nanocomposites based on organic-inorganic nanohybrids. Three nanocomposites were prepared with different weight ratios of polyaniline to polyvinyl alcohol and fixed weight ratio of calcium oxide nanoparticles. The thermal analyses showed higher thermal stability of the three phase nanocomposites compared to the protonated polyaniline. Both DC and AC electrical characterizations showed that the highest concentration of polyaniline gave a semi-metallic behavior for polyvinyl alcohol at low voltages. Also, the AC parameters (Z', Z"") showed varying behaviors for all the prepared nanocomposites at different temperatures. Where, the impedance of the nanocomposite increased in the temperature range from 30 °C to 80 °C and then decreased monotonically from 90 °C to 140 °C. This electrical behavior showed very interesting outcomes, which opens up new horizons for many applications for such three phase composites, especially in the field of electronics and sensors. © 2019."

Tensile strength is of a predominant requirement for an electrical contact joint to perform the satisfactory function. In this work, an effort has been taken to propose realistic joining conditions for process improvement in ultrasonic metal welding of joining an electrical contact comprising of metallic wire and a flat metallic sheet made of copper material. Taguchi's method is incorporated for the design of experiments. An experimental investigation is carried out to study the effect of process parameters such as clamping pressure, the amplitude of vibration of the sonotrode and weld time on tensile strength of the electrical contacts. Analysis of variance is performed to establish the significant effect of joining conditions on the response variable. The regression model has been developed using the results obtained from experiments to predict the strength of the joint for varying combinations of process parameters. The results of this study indicate that the clamping pressure is the significant parameter influencing the strength of the joint followed by the amplitude of vibration of the sonotrode and the weld time. The parameters identified for achieving maximum tensile strength of the joint are the clamping pressure of 2 bar, the amplitude of vibration of the sonotrode of 57 μm and the weld time of 2.5 seconds. Confirmation experiments are carried out to validate the optimum combination of process parameters for achieving the maximum strength of the joint. © 2019 Jordan Journal of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering."

These films are characterized as much by the depiction of clever criminals as the cultivation of a cynical disposition from which transgressions of this sort appear stylish and violence is rendered ‘cool’. Almost all of them turn on a scheme to dupe others of a large sum of money, and are punctuated by backstabbing partners in crime, tables turning by chance, edgy armed standoffs and a surprising number of bodies in car trunks. Given the dark portrait of Lagos these films present, one might be inclined to read the genre cycle as a reiteration of the role Lagos has historically played as embodiment of popular anxieties concerning insecurity, material inequality and social breakdown. And yet, in recent years, conditions within the city have markedly improved over those of the deepest point of urban crisis in the 1990s when Lagos was, indeed, para-lysed by a generalized condition of insecurity and dysfunction. New Nollywood’s repertoire of film styles has expanded to include international film cycles and genres such as romantic comedies, psychological thrillers, police procedurals, among others. This raises important questions about the nature of correspondences between cinema and the city, such as whether New Nollywood genre films tell us anything about social, cultural or historical circumstances in Lagos, or the place the city occupies in the popular imagination, for instance. Recent upmarket film noirs speak, instead, to the evolution of Lagos as a media capital. I examine the different kinds of work genre performs in New and Old Nollywood films and propose a number of ways to critically interpret genre’s various registers. © 2019 Intellect Ltd."

This study introduced a methodology of sheep’s chewing sound recognition based on sparse representation classification. Experiments were performed on Heka Sheep Farm in Qinghai, using a herd of 148 sheep. Data were collected by monitoring the feeding process of 8 sheep in an enclosed area. Each sheep was monitored by two recording devices, one for recording the sheep sound at the feeding trough while the other which was at 2 m away to record environmental noise. The collected audio was processed and labeled as chewing, bleating, impact, or environmental noise. Acoustic vector was extracted from each audio frame based on Mel-frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) methodology. A combination of entropy weight method and principal component analysis method (PCA) was performed for weighted optimization on MFCC as the characteristic parameter. Finally, a sparse representation classifier (SRC) was adopted as the sheep chewing classifier. The trained model was tested on a testing dataset (per sheep) and achieved the highest accuracy of 96.52%. The developed SRC model outperformed the support vector machine model on comparison. Additionally, the SRC model could further reduce the noise and improve the recognition accuracy in the case of a small amount of residual noise in the sample data. Therefore, this developed system can be used as an acoustic system in grazing livestock monitoring with the aim of accurate detection of feeding activity in sheep. © 2019, Asian Association for Agricultural Engineering.

In order to maintain a suitable boom height between the sprayer boom and the ground or the crop canopy, an automatic control system of boom height was designed and applied to improve the spray deposition uniformity in this work. Three ultrasonic sensors installed on the three-section boom were used to detect the height of each boom in real time. The movement direction (up or down) and speed of each boom were controlled by the hydraulic system which adjusted the boom height according to the boom height target and the actual boom height. The structure of the boom sprayer and the adjusting principle of the three-section boom including the software and hardware of the control system were described. Ground tests were carried out to compare the spray deposition characteristics between the unadjusted pattern and the adjusted pattern. The results showed that the impact of the boom in the unadjusted pattern on the spray height was significant when the sprayer passed a step track, especially for the left and right booms, and similar results were also obtained in the droplet distribution. In the adjusted pattern, there was a relatively small effect on the spray height and droplet distribution when the boom passed through the step track. The deposition coefficient of variation (CV) was up to 30.06% when the boom passed through the step track in the unadjusted pattern, while in the adjusted pattern it was less than 12.35%. The automatic control system of the boom height could keep the boom at an appropriate spray height, which could make a contribution to improve the deposition uniformity and the pesticide application effect for the boom sprayer. © 2019, Asian Association for Agricultural Engineering.

It has been found that a complex magnetic configuration has formed as a result of appearance of new bipolar sunspots near the tail sunspots.

In the case of September 22, repeated eruptions of prominences before the CME took place, while on September 24, recurrent jets were observed before and after the CME. In both cases, a CME merging could take place, after which the precipitating substance led to the development of long flares in the soft X-ray range and the formation of a post-eruptive arcade, which was clearly visible in the extreme ultraviolet lines. © 2019, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd."

However, environmental factors and production technologies-most noteworthy, mineral fertilization programs-significantly affect its organoleptic and nutritional quality. The objective of this research was to find an organic/inorganic fertilization formula that increases the organoleptic quality potential of Mexican strawberry cv. Zamorana. The hypothesis was that the organic or inorganic fertilization systems used in the plant do not affect the characteristics of the fruit quality. The fertilization treatments were: Chemical, Chemical-Organic 1°, Organic 1°, Chemical-Organic 2°, Organic 2°, and Chemical-Mycorrhiza 3°; each treatment was applied in three plants in a completely randomized design with a 3×6 factorial arrangement. Fruits in 3/4 red state were harvested from the three plants and in this fruits, the following characteristics were determined: N, P, K, and Ca content, fruit biomass, total soluble solids (SST), Titratable Acidity (AT) and vitamin C content; additionally, the SST/AT index was calculated. The results were analyzed with ANOVA and Tukey's multiple comparison test (p≤0.05), using SAS 9.4. Fruits with organic fertilization had higher N and P content; in addition, the SST and the SST/AT ratio were higher than in inorganic fertilization. Inorganic fertilization combined with mycorrhizae increased the K and Ca concentration and also affected the firmness of the fruits. The chemical and organic combination contributed to increase the size of the fruit; meanwhile, the AT and vitamin C content were not significantly different between treatments. © 2019 Colegio de Postgraduados."

In this paper, we present an automated method for monitoring the electrophysical parameters of planar dielectrics with increased requirements on accuracy and resolution. A brief review and comparative analysis of the known methods for monitoring the parameters of solid dielectrics are performed here. The method of microwave control of the heterogeneities of the parameters of planar dielectrics by the wave characteristics of a scanning microstrip line (MSL) using a Radon transform is described. The phase response of the MSL is shown to be most sensitive to parameter heterogeneities. A mathematical model for processing the MSL wave characteristics and for constructing a map of the parameter heterogeneity distribution is presented. The parameter realizability and the applicability limits of the mathematical model are estimated. The technical implementation of the method is considered using, as an example, the setup for monitoring the parameter homogeneity of planar dielectrics and the results of modeling the measuring part of the setup in the AWR Microwave Office CAD system. The methodological errors of measuring the electrophysical parameters of dielectrics by the described method are estimated, and they are on average ±1 × 10–4 in the case of measuring the permittivity and 0.2 mm in the case of measuring the spatial resolution according to the preliminary calculations. The described control method is designed for use in the production of electronic products using dielectric materials with a high level of parameter repeatability. © 2019, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd."

A wide range of pharmaceutical agents are utilized as augmentation therapy in order to increase the efficacy of antipsychotic medication treatment. Memantine, a noncompetitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist is one of these add-on agents. In this study we aimed to assess the efficacy of memantine augmentation by conducting a systematic review and meta-analysis on the psychopathology of patients with schizophrenia receving antipsychotic medication. Method: We analyzed the double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trials of memantine add-on treatment given to schizophrenia patients receiving antipsychotic medications. The primary outcome measure was amelioration of negative symptoms and the secondary outcome measures were amelioration of positive, total and general psycopathology symptoms. Publication bias was evaluated by the Funnel plot and Egger test. Results: Eleven studies on a total of 570 cases were included. Although memantine add-on treatment was superior to placebo for ameliorating negative symptoms (SMD=0.596, 95% CI=0.075-1.118, p=0.025), there were not any statistically significant differences in the amelioration of general psycopathology (SMD=0.034, 95% CI=0.419-0.488, p=0.883), the positive (SMD=-0.041, 95% CI=0.217-0.135, p=0.650) and the overall symptoms. (SMD=0.315, 95% CI=0.256-0.887, p=0.280). Publication bias was not observed between studies according to the results of the Funnel plots and Egger tests. Conclusion: Memantine augmentation treatment is beneficial for treating particularly the negative symptoms of schizophrenia patients.

For the films, both concentrations of intrinsic copper vacancies and electronic holes decrease with increasing calcination temperature from 400 to 500 to 600 oC. Li(I) doping into CuO leads to the reduction of copper-vacancy concentration and the enhancement of hole density. The increase of calcination temperature or Li(I) doping concentration in the film increases both optical band gap energy and Cu2p binding energy, which are characterized by UV-vis-NIR and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, respectively. The overall hole density of the film is determined by the offset effect of intrinsic and extrinsic hole densities, which depend on the calcination temperature and the Li(I) doping amount, respectively. The apparent resistance of the film is determined by the concentration of the structural defects such as copper vacancies, Li(I) dopants, and grain boundaries, as well as by the hole density. As a result, it is found that the gas response value of the film sensor is directly proportional to the apparent sensor resistance. © Materials Research Society of Korea, All rights reserved."

The aim of this work was to attempt to improve the quality of the contact by traditional annealing of the structure as a whole, and by annealing an individual contact by electric current pulses. The dynamics of the resistance of ohmic contacts under traditional isothermal annealing at a temperature of T = 573 K in the time interval t = 15…120 minutes was analyzed. It was established that to reduce the transition resistance of ohmic contacts in the Al-Ti-Si system, local heating of the contact by electric current pulses can also be used. In this work, the optimal parameters of the rectangular current pulse were selected, which made it possible to reduce the transition resistance by 1.6 times. It was found that during electric annealing of contacts with a current density exceeding 6·1010 A/m2 and a duration of 600 μs, the transition resistance behaved unstably, which was associated with the development of degradation processes in a thin-film system. © Rushing Water Publishers Ltd. 2019."

Probability of the failure-free operation of the TS during performance of task is selected as the criterion of the failure-free performance. Volume of a unit may be different: from 1 (partial redundancy) up to the total quantity of main components m (full redundancy). At any volumes of the varied units of redundancy, criterion of the failure-free performance is the criterion of the monotonically decreasing nature depending on quantity of the included main components m, because of probability of failure-free operation of the redundant system is determined as the product of probabilities of failure-free operation of the redundant units, which are included into the system. This property makes it possible to ensure step-by-step construction of the tree of possible structures of the unit redundancy depending on value of m. This tree has the following property: at each step of branching, new units include unit structures of the previous steps in accordance with the assumption that the solutions, which were made at the previous steps, were optimal solutions. Therefore, it is possible to state that this tree is the tree of the conditional optimal solutions (the COD tree). At the prescribed failure-free performance of components and switches, as well as at the prescribed degree of redundancy, the step-by-step building-up of the system (attachment of components in random order) makes it possible to move over one of the branches of the COD tree from the very beginning; thus, obtaining the unconditional optimal solution for any volume of the system.

We studied a critical characteristic of WK function, the arterial pressure-decay constant tau, to test whether all arterial regions share the same WK characteristics, which should theoretically be related to arterial stiffness. We performed carotid and forearm arterial tonometry (Sphygmocor) and modeled arterial pressure (P) as A + (SBP - A)·exp[-(t - t0)/tau], where A = minimum pressure, SBP = systolic BP, t = time, t0 = start of decay). Model validity was supported by strong between-site correlations for t0 and A. We also measured central and peripheral Pulse Wave Velocity (PWV, Colin VP1000) and calculated arterial compliances (1/PWV2) in the heart-femoral (hf) and femoral-ankle (fa) regions. For the full cohort [n = 98, mean (SD): age 50 (20) years, weight 81 (17) kg, BP 135/77 (17/12) mmHg, 38% female], carotid and forearm taus were different [283 (126) vs. 199 (88) ms, p < 0.000] and uncorrelated (r2 = 0.01). Although hf and fa arterial compliances were well correlated (p < 0.000), neither was closely correlated with carotid or forearm tau (r2 < 0.06). In a subset (n = 22), carotid and brachial blood flow (Ultramark 9) were measured and regional WK compliances were calculated (= tau/regional resistance). Carotid blood flow [571 (216) vs. 117 (84) mL/min, p < 0.000] and WK compliance [0.031 (0.017) vs. 0.004 (0.004) mL/mmHg, p < 0.000] were much higher than corresponding forearm values.

It does so to illuminate how health narratives operate to minimise the impact that conflicts on the nature and substance of EU solidarity have on policy development in response to the perceived crisis. A governmentality lens is used to analyse the implications of increasingly prescribed policy applications based on screening and categorising, and how measures operate to responsibilise migrants and third-countries to act according to EU values.

Cell apoptosis was assessed by flow cytometry. The expression of caspase-8 and the cleavage of poly ADP ribose polymerase were assessed by Western blotting analysis. Lipid rafts and Fas distribution were determined by immunofluorescence microscopy. Apatinib suppressed breast cancer cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, apatinib enhanced the aggregation of lipid rafts and the redistribution of Fas into lipid rafts. Pretreatment with methyl-β-cyclodextrin, a cholesterol-sequestering agent, significantly reversed Fas redistribution and apatinib-induced apoptosis.

A lot of impurities including cotton stalks and soil blocks were included in the plastic film residue, and meanwhile, the film residue severely intertwined with cotton stalks and soil blocks and thus can hardly be directly utilized. It is necessary to design a separation device for the mechanized-collected film/impurity agglomerate. By analyzing manual sorting process of film/impurity agglomerate, the combined action of airflow cleaning and drum sieving was determined as the optimal separation scheme. The measured suspended velocities of film residue, cotton stalks, and soil blocks were 1.82~3.21, 5.95~10.25, and 8.95~12.80 m/s, respectively. Based on the measured suspended velocities, both physical and technical conflicts in the system were analyzed and solved according to the conflict resolution principle, and innovative designs were made on the drum sieve and the enclosed cover. In order to improve the drum sieve’s operating performance, the drum sieve pores with different diameters of 30, 40 and 50 mm were arranged along the sieving direction, and a novel structure of the enclosed cover was designed. According to the design principle of orthogonal test, the drum rotating speed, the airflow velocity at the outlet of the fan and the width of the spiral blades were used as the test factors, and the optimal operating parameters were determined. Using the optimal parameter settings (i.e., the drum rotating speed, the airflow velocity at the fan outlet and the blade width were 24 r/min, 6.15 m/s and 70 mm), both the proportion of impurities in the separated film residue and the proportion of film residue in the separated impurities reached the minima of 11.13% and 0.082%, respectively. © 2019, Asian Association for Agricultural Engineering.

Deflection of an oscillating conductor from the straight line connecting its ends with regard to the initial sagging is assumed to be small as compared with the span length, as a result the tension can be estimated approximately as a constant as well as the tensile strain. The dependence of the strain on the transverse displacements of conductors is defined by the quadratic approximation. The coefficients of expansions of the conductor displacements and twisting angle in sine series with integer number of loops per span are considered as generalized coordinates as well as their values at end points. The aerodynamic loads acting on the oscillating iced conductor are determined using the conventional quasi-steady dependence for the lift, drag, and couple on the disturbed angle of attack. The equations of motion of the conductor with nonlinear elastic, inertial and aerodynamic forces are formulated in the generalized coordinates, and the appropriate linearized equations for small aeroelastic oscillations around the static equilibrium position are derived. The latter equations allow one to determine the critical speed of the conductor flutter. The critical flutter speed of the conductor with uniform icing are computed, and the effect of the non-linearities and some parameters on the conductor behavior are estimated using the proposed model. © Rushing Water Publishers Ltd. 2019."

This, in turn, might threaten the very existence of that individual. Although there are a lot of advancements in the medical field, sometimes it becomes impossible to treat the defects in the organs. This strikes the need for organ transplantation and organ donation forms the basis for the same. Materials and Methods: This is a cross-sectional study that was conducted at Saveetha Medical College and Hospitals, Tamil Nadu. Medical college students of all years starting from the 1st year to interns were included in the study, whereas those students who were unwilling to participate in the study were excluded from the study. A self-administered questionnaire consisting 15 multiple-choice questions in English was developed and handed over to the students. Results: From the collected data, it was found that most of the medical college students irrespective of their year of study had inadequate knowledge of organ donation and embalming. Conclusion: With a steady rise in cases of organ failures, organ transplantation is a viable treatment option, but the shortage of organ donors poses a setback to this potential solution. It is, therefore, essential to give importance to organ donation and transplantation and this can be successfully done by incorporating these topics in their regular curriculum. © 2019 AME Publishing Company.

Moreover, if no measurement is done to prevent, control, and treat it, there will be many problems for the community. This study is a descriptive cross-sectional study. Data were analyzed by SPSS software (version 16) using independent samples t-test, one-way ANOVA at the significant level of α = 0.05. Results: The mean of knowledge score was 3.38 ± 12.49 of 20 and the mean score of performance was 3.85 ± 0.91 of 5, and both were at an average level. Independent samples t-test and one-way ANOVA analyzed the relationship between the mean score of knowledge and performance of the subjects with literacy, marital status, and gender; however, there was only a significant correlation between knowledge and literacy (P = 0.001). Conclusion: The mean score of knowledge and performance of the subjects was moderate regarding diabetes. Since there is a direct relationship between a person’s knowledge of an issue and his or her insight and performance, it is hoped to raise the awareness about diabetes and improve individuals’ performance through such methods as conducting health and medical education sessions on diabetes mellitus and imaging fatal outcomes on the individual. © 2019 Giuffre Editore SpA.

In this paper, with six maize hybrids of 1609 ear images from eight different experiments during 2005 to 2011, we developed a simple and general empirical model for estimating the ear volume of maize with ear diameter (D) and length (L), i.e., the ear volume in maize could be estimated by multiplying the ear dimensions (L*D2) by a correction factor of 0.5901 (r2 = 0.989) corresponding to the slope of the pooled regression equation. In the validation run with independent data, the simulated ear volume of different sizes ear of four hybrids were in satisfactory agreement with observed values and were within ±15% of the measured values with a mean normalized gross error (MNGE) of 2.73%-3.26%. The empirical simulation model adequately reproduced the actual ear volume of maize from experiment data and could be suggested to use for general applicability in maize cultivation and breeding. © 2019, Asian Association for Agricultural Engineering.

The present study of spatial relationship between mother and calf of great Indian rhinoceros Rhinoceros unicornis was carried out during 2016-2018 in Kaziranga National Park of Assam, India. Spatial distance, approach/follow/leave behaviours and major cause of calf death were the main objectives of the study. Photographic technique and range finder was used to measure the distance opportunistically along the road side and near major water holes. Data were collected using Scan animal sampling. The calves were divided into three age groups- 0-1 year, 1-2 years and 2-3 years. Each age group showed different spatial distance requirement which was found to be statistically significant. The distance increased gradually from the first group to the third group with the increase in age. Moreover, leave behaviors was found more in first group of calf and approach was higher among second calf group. First and second calf group prefer the range of 0-5 meter distance around the mother, whereas the third group prefer 5.1-10 meter range. This range around the mother was found to be secure for the calf survival. The occurrence of calf following mother was found higher than mother following calves. Tiger kill of rhino calf was found to be the major threat in Kaziranga National Park. Male rhino calves were more vulnerable than the female calf, which indicates the use of larger territory and stray behaviour of the males. © TCRP 2019."

Some authors argue that absolute income levels are most important for happiness, while others argued that the connection between the two is more relative. The aim of this study was to find out the peculiarities of attitudes towards income in different groups of income and perceived socio-economic status in a representative sample of Lithuanian population (n=1001). The results of the study revealed statistically significant differences in financial satisfaction between different income quintile groups, with mean ranks in the lowest income quintile being more than twice lower than in the highest income quintile. The results of the study showed statistically significant differences in financial satisfaction between different groups of subjective socio-economic stratification, where the mean ranks in the subjectively poorest group were about five times lower than in the subjectively rich group. The results of the survey revealed that people who think they have enough money to meet their needs (10%) have higher scores on psychological prosperity, life satisfaction, self-efficacy, and psychological resilience. This group also showed higher earnings in euros per month. Persons who think that there is no shortage of money for living (59.8%) have statistically significantly higher scores on the 10-point happiness scale, life satisfaction, hope, self-efficacy, psychological resilience, optimism. Individuals who think that income enables good and healthy eating (35.4%) have statistically significantly higher estimates of happiness on a 10-point scale, as well as higher income in euros per month. Persons who think that income provides good housing conditions (31.4%) have statistically significantly higher happiness on a 10-point scale, as well as higher income in euros per month. Persons who think that income allows for a good rest, rebuilding power, seeing the world (7.9%) have statistically significantly higher happiness scores on the 10-point scale, as well as higher income in euros per month. Those who think that income enables education, learning, development (19.7%) have statistically significantly higher estimates of happiness on a 10-point scale, as well as higher income in euros per month.

This study aimed to investigate the associations between total serum vitamin D level and arterial stiffness assessed by brachial-ankle Pulse Wave Velocity (baPWV) and atherosclerosis assessed by Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI) in a Chinese community-dwelling elderly cohort. About 175 elderly participants (91 males and 84 females) were recruited. The levels of total serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D], blood glucose, lipids and pressure were determined with clinical tests. We found 87.4% of elderly Chinese showed vitamin D deficiency (<20 ng/mL) and insufficiency (21-29 ng/mL). For these patients, the total 25(OH)D was positively correlated with right (r = 0.230, p = 0.004) and left ABI (r = 0.212, p = 0.008), whereas there was no correlation with right and left baPWV (r = -0.136 and -0.137, p = 0.092 and 0.089, respectively). In univariate linear regression, total serum 25(OH)D was positively associated with left and right ABI (p < 0.05). Multivariate regression suggested total serum 25(OH)D was independently correlated with the left and right ABI with adjustment for sex, age and Diastolic Blood Pressure (DBP). No significant association between total serum 25(OH)D level and baPWV was found. The study suggested that serum total 25(OH)D may be favorably associated with ABI in the elderly population with vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency; however, it may not correlated with arterial stiffness measured by baPWV. More prospective larger scale studies are warranted to validate these findings. © 2019 Association for Research into Arterial Structure and Physiology."

For this purpose, the air flow velocity meters utilizing the acoustic method are used. These meters have a short response and no mechanically moving elements. However, their large size and the presence of construction units subjected to considerable deformation under the mechanical impact make it difficult to implement these meters as parts of moving objects. In this work, the operation algorithm of a device measuring the airflow velocity using the ultrasonic transducers is analyzed. We show that the reduction in the size of such devices leads to a decrease in the measurement accuracy without the improvement of the methods for determining the propagation time of an ultrasonic pulse between transducers and without periodic calibration of the device. The block diagram is developed and the main elements are considered for the computing device, which makes it possible to determine the longitudinal and transverse components of the airflow velocity using four ultrasonic transducers. The laboratory tests in an air tunnel with a distance between sensors of 60 mm showed that this device makes it possible to determine the airflow velocity with the maximum absolute measurement error of 2.5 m/s. This error is considerably affected by the structural elements of the device that obscure the measurement area but yield the required strength characteristics. The proposed error compensation algorithm based on the approximation method by trigonometric functions significantly reduces the maximum measurement error to 1.2 m/s. Further improvement of the device’s characteristics requires additional studies to find the shape of the sensor block and refinement of the error compensation algorithms. © 2019, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd."

Based on the two-dimensional vibration model of high-speed plow in ABAQUS, the soil-cutting under additional vibration conditions was simulated. The three factors were studied by comparing the simulation results under different amplitudes, initial speeds, and tillage depths. The effect of drag reduction effect was analyzed, and the optimal drag reduction effect of high-speed plow was obtained. Through theoretical analysis and simulation analysis, the working characteristics of high-speed plows were further comprehended. Further field test results show the feasibility of two-dimensional vibration drag reduction, which verifies the theoretical analysis and simulation experiments with considerable accuracy. This study provides a theoretical reference for the performance optimization of drag reduction and debonding of agricultural machinery in the future. © 2019, Asian Association for Agricultural Engineering.

There is a phenomenon that low frequency impulse modulates high frequency vibration. The modulated signal is often very weak. At the same time, there are various background noises. The traditional Fourier transform cannot extract the low frequency impulse frequency domain feature of the modulated signal. In this paper, EMD method was used to extract feature of weak fault signal of agricultural machinery rotating part, including simulation signal and the laser land leveler vibration signal. The EMD method and Hilbert transform were used to extract the time-frequency feature of the simulation signal of machinery fault vibration, including the low-frequency impulse and time-frequency feature of the modulated signal. The vibration experiment of the laser land leveler has been carried out. EMD and Hilbert transform were used to extract the time-frequency feature of the experimental data. The time-frequency feature of vibration experimental data has been obtained. It was found that the fault vibration signal of the laser land leveler had multiple modulations. The processing result of vibration experimental data showed that EMD method could overcome the shortcoming of Fourier transform and correctly extract the weak fault feature of the laser land leveler plow bearing. © 2019, Asian Association for Agricultural Engineering.

The experiments are conducted on polar cut samples without preliminary polarization with the symmetric indium conducting coatings. The short-circuit currents remaining for a fairly a long time and the current decay with time are observed at room temperature on all the samples. The temperature dependences of the short-circuit currents in the temperature ranges of 16 to 45°С for Rochelle salt and 16–110°С for triglycine sulfate are obtained. The short-circuit currents are observed in these crystals both in the ferroelectric and paraphase. It is shown that, upon heating in the ferroelectric phase, the total short-circuit current is determined by competing processes: the pyroelectric currents and electrochemical decomposition currents. In the paraphase, the short-circuit currents are the electrochemical self-decomposition currents. Based on the experimental results obtained, it is demonstrated that the short-circuit current flow through the polar cut samples of Rochelle salt and triglycine sulfate crystals is induced by the intrinsic emf caused by the electrochemical self-decomposition of the opposite surfaces of the sample polar cuts when in contact with the conducting coatings due to the anisotropy of these surfaces. A model of the electrochemical self-decomposition in such crystals is proposed. © 2019, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd."

In particular, increasing the level of industrial production contributes to the intensification of economic development. A high level of economic development determines the requirements for the ecological environment. This position sets the parity of requirements for the sufficiency of ensuring the environmental security of the territory. The novelty of the study is determined by the fact that the authors considered the relations between the level of development of the territory and environmental security. In this case, environmental security is understood not only as a collection of payments for the negative impact on the environment, but primarily as a guarantee of the level of public health. In the work, the authors presented a model that takes into account these aspects and forms the limits of its application. The developed model is given in the article, the ways of its application in single-industry towns are determined.

The search for effective methods for cooling electronic systems dictates the need for the development of methods for the numerical analysis of heat transfer in nanostructures. A characteristic feature of the energy transfer in such systems is the dominant role of contact thermal resistance at interlayer interfaces. Since the contact resistance depends on a number of factors associated with the manufacturing technology of heterostructures, it is of great importance to determine the corresponding coefficients from the results of temperature measurements. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the possibility of reconstructing the thermal resistance coefficients at the interfaces between layers by solving the inverse problem of heat transfer. The complex of algorithms includes two major blocks: a block for solving the direct heat transfer problem in a layered nanostructure and an optimization block for solving the inverse problem. The direct problem is formulated in an algebraic (finite difference) form under the assumption of a constant temperature within each layer due to their small thickness. The inverse problem is solved in the extreme formulation and optimized using zero-order methods that do not require calculating the derivatives of the optimized function. As a basic optimization algorithm, the Nelder–Mead method is used in combination with random restarts to search for the global minimum. The results of identifying the contact thermal resistance coefficients obtained in the context of a quasi-real experiment are presented. The accuracy of the solution of the identification problem is estimated as a function of the number of layers in the heterostructure and the measurement error. The results are planned to be used in the new technique of multiscale modeling of thermal regimes of the electronic component base of the microwave range, when identifying the thermal conductivity coefficients of the heterostructure. © 2019, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd."

In accordance with previously accepted principles, the calculating algorithm is closed under the input satellite data; there are no requirements for additional information, which often significantly limit the applicability of new data processing techniques. The described step of the analysis is naturally associated with the already-existing algorithms and is based on the results of calculations carried out with their help (spatiotemporal interpolation of fields of geophysical parameters of the Earth atmosphere–ocean system) to evaluate the advective fluxes of the derived quantities. When the fields of integrated atmospheric vapor content are used as the input, the results of the calculations are latent heat fluxes in standard units (MW).

To improve the performance of the estimation algorithm, a nonlinear batch filter, based on the unscented transform (UT) that overcomes the disadvantages of the least-squares (LS) batch filter, is utilized. The LS and UT batch filter algorithms are verified through numerical simulation analysis using artificial optical measurements. We use the real optical observation data of a low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite, Cryosat-2, observed from optical wide-field patrol network (OWL-Net), to verify the performance of the POD software developed. The effects of light travel time, annual aberration, and diurnal aberration are considered as error models to correct OWL-Net data. As a result of POD, measurement residual and estimated state vector of the LS batch filter converge to the local minimum when the initial orbit error is large or the initial covariance matrix is smaller than the initial error level. However, UT batch filter converges to the global minimum, irrespective of the initial orbit error and the initial covariance matrix. © 2019 The Korean Space Science Society."

Due to the spread of the values of these parameters, the uncertainty of delays appears, which leads to the necessity to define the ranges of possible delay values. The peak current in power lines when switching the inputs of gates is another factor increasingly influencing the design process of CMOS circuits in the transition to nanometer technologies. The value of the peak current is used to estimate the voltage drop in the power lines, which in turn is necessary to calculate the width of the power lines of CMOS circuits and switch off the transistors in the method of reducing the static power. The methods of full circuit simulation do not comprehensively analyze the circuits with a large number of inputs and the methods at the logical level of designing CMOS circuits do not provide the desired accuracy of the evaluation of the values of the delays and the peak current in the circuit. The problem of increasing the accuracy and the reliability of the analysis of the performance and peak currents of CMOS combinational circuits, taking into account the simultaneous switching of the inputs, as well as the analysis of logical correlations of the signals, is considered. The proposed method is based on using the cubic approximation of the correction difference of delays, taking into account the simultaneous switching of inputs. It is shown that the developed techniques of the analysis of the performance and peak currents of CMOS combinational circuits improve the accuracy of the upper estimates of the analyzed parameters by up to 3% compared with accurate simulation and make it possible to reduce the pessimistic upper estimate by factors of 2 to 3 compared with the estimate of the worst case. The developed methods of improving the accuracy of simulating delays and peak currents of combinational CMOS-circuits can be used as an addition to the existing CADS tools for VLSI for noise-immunity analysis, the analysis of the peak currents, characterization of complex functional units, and improving the accuracy of classical static analysis. To improving the accuracy of the interval estimates of the minimum delays and maximum peak current, the simulation methods taking into account the simultaneous switching of the inputs of the logical element are developed. In relation to the circuit simulation, the error of these methods does not exceed 3%. Compared with the results obtained without taking the simultaneous switching into account, reducing the minimum delay by up to 50% and the pessimistic estimate of the peak current of combinational circuits is reduced on average by 50–55%. © 2019, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd."

The vegetative cover of the park was positively correlated to, and had a significant effect on bird species diversity in the park. A total abundance of 620 bird species of 18 families were recorded during the work. 408 species out of the 620 species were observed to be aquatic while 212 birds were observed in the terrestrial region of the zone. The dominant species around the aquatic zone was the Nettapus auritus with a frequency of one hundred and thirty one (131) species observed at different time zones. The second most populated aquatic species was the Ardeola ibis with ninety one (91) spe-cies. The Actophilornis africana (Jesus bird) was much and found around the Muyi part of the lake due to the vegetation on the water surface. The Ardea goliath was the least species found in the area with just two species seen throughout the stud periody. Species that made the highest contribution to relative abundance included the Nettapus auritus (21.13) seconded by the Ardeola ibis (14.68) and then the Actophilornis africana (7.77) while the least contributions were from the Ardea goliath (0.21), Coracias cyanogaster (0.31), Phalacrocorax aristo-telis (0.73) and the Salpornis salvadori (0.83).

It is established that the structural strength of three-dimensional microelectronic modules and the operating characteristics of adhesive-bonded joints depend on many factors. The most important factors among them are the properties of the adhesive material, the structure of the joints and the operating conditions. The types of loads, which affect the modules during their operation and their influence on the structural strength are considered. It is revealed that irregular loads, such as peeling and bending, are the most dangerous loading types for the adhesive-bonded joints of modules. It is established that in peeling a high concentration of edge stresses arises, which leads to the destruction of the joints, and in bending there is a concentration of normal and tangential stresses along the length of the glue lines. The types of adhesive materials which are used for assembling the modules are analyzed. The adhesive materials are selected taking the main design and technological constraints and the requirements on adhesive-bonded joints into account. The module’s structures are simulated and the influence of the physical, mechanical, and thermal properties of the adhesive materials on the stresses in the adhesive-bonded joints and the strength of the products under the impact of inertial loads with an acceleration of 1000g and heated by 40°С is determined. Recommendations on the simulation of adhesive-bonded joints of three-dimensional microelectronic modules are made. The obtained results revealed that the stresses depend on the elastic properties of the adhesive-bonded joints, as well as on the nature and value of the load on them, and they are determined by the mechanical strength and rigidity of the adhesive material. In order to reduce the stresses, it is necessary to use more rigid structural materials, and the adhesive materials need to be chosen based on the operating conditions of the microelectronic module. © 2019, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd."
"Real-time object detection applied on drones","2019","International Agricultural Engineering Journal","0","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85081577884&partnerID=40&md5=52a10d310eb6c6641f1765cbc8a0ad1b","In recent years, drones weigh increasingly heavily in people’s life. However, the application of drones is still at the basic level. Combined with computer vision techniques, drones can process images and extract information in real-time and can be applied to more complicated scenarios, for instance, detecting maturity of crops, real-time monitoring of forest fires and detecting rubbish in rivers. In this paper, a general scheme for real-time detection applied on drones was proposed, which can be used in a great majority of object detection tasks. The scheme was implemented by adding an image processing module, and placing Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) deployed object detection model on traditional drones. Nvidia Jetson Nano was selected as appropriate hardware equipment for the scheme, and a real-time, precise detection algorithm named YOLOv3, which is considered as the most efficient and effective method for object detection nowadays was used for object detection. In this paper, a city vehicle detection task was achieved, showing how this scheme works. For completing this task, a new dataset called VD-512 was made. In the experiments, the YOLOv3 algorithm was compared with the Faster-RCNN algorithm and was applied to predict real city vehicle images captured by DJI Mavic Pro 2. The experiment results showed that the trained model using YOLOv3 algorithm had fast processing speed, high accuracy and high generalization performance, which proved that this scheme can be used in real scenes. Combining the technology of computer vision, the future development of drones will be broader. Some scenarios that need real-time and flexibility can be solved by drones using this scheme. © 2019, Asian Association for Agricultural Engineering. All rights reserved."
"Mechanical properties of degradable film","2019","International Agricultural Engineering Journal","0","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85081577126&partnerID=40&md5=83cc4d2a29c94e11286e00970037bd9e","Degradable film mulching technology has the advantages of increasing ground temperature, saving water, fertilizer and pesticide, and thus increasing yield. It is an ecological planting technology to control weeds without white pollution through physical methods, demonstrating great significance in the sustainable development of agricultural production. In order to study the mechanical properties of the degradable film, uniaxial stretching and creep deformation test was carried out on samples by an electronic universal testing machine. The test results showed that there was anisotropy in tensile properties of the degradable film in both longitudinal and transverse directions, the average tensile strength of the degradable film under different tensile speeds was between 13.761~15.699 MPa, the average tensile strength in transverse direction was between 10.631~13.959 MPa; average fracture strain in longitudinal direction was between 218.946%~237.130%, and that in transverse direction was between 311.134%~336.832%. The longitudinal tangent elastic modulus of the origin of the sample was between 212.534~251.816 MP, the transverse tangent elastic modulus of the origin of the sample was between 167.019~200.862 MPa. It can be seen that compared with the transverse direction, the longitudinal tensile strength of the degradable film was higher, fracture strain was lower and elastic modulus was higher. The tangent tensile strength was increased with the increase of tensile speed; the longitudinal tensile stress analysis of the degradable film showed that the stress distribution of the gauge length of the dumbbell-shaped was uniform, and the rectangular samples and the damaged samples had high stress concentration at right angles. Using the Burgers model to study the creep process of the degradable film and fit the characteristic curve, the creep characteristic parameters were worked out with ideal fitting effects, and the determination coefficient was R2>0.9. Analysis results showed that the creep process was produced by the interaction between elastic dynamic and viscous resistance of the degradable film. The research results can provide a reference for the design of film-mulching machinery. © 2019, Asian Association for Agricultural Engineering. All rights reserved."

To get full benefits from (CVVT) various types of mechanisms have been proposed and designed. Some of these mechanisms are in production and have shown significant benefits in improving engine performance. In this investigation a newly designed gear drive mechanism that controls the intake valve opening (IVO) and closing (IVC) angles is studied. The control scheme is based on maximizing the engine brake power (P) and specific fuel consumption (BSFC) at any engine speed by continuously varying the phase between the cam shaft angle and the crank shaft angle. A single-cylinder engine is simulated by the “LOTUS” software to find out the optimum phase angle for maximum power and minimum fuel consumption at a given engine speed. The mechanism is a planetary gear drive designed for precise and continuous control. This mechanism has a simple design and operation conditions which can change the phase angle without limitation. © 2019, Hampstead Psychological Associates. All rights reserved."

"A multi-label classification method for agricultural text based on LC-rakel","2019","International Agricultural Engineering Journal","0","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85081547551&partnerID=40&md5=596deeb69a2d7e264c7b85367dfea28a","With the rapid development of internet, agricultural information has exploded. The classification of agricultural texts can effectively realize the organization and management of information, and help people accurately locate and identify the required information. Text multi-label classification refers to a text labeled as multiple categories because of more than one semantic. In the real word, different industries in agriculture are crossed and overlapped, which lead to the fact that an agricultural text usually has multiple semantics. Therefore, it is more practical to conduct multi-label classification of agricultural texts. In the paper, the multi-label text classification algorithm was studied, and by considering the correlation between labels, a multi-label classification method for agricultural texts based on Label Correlation Random k-labelsets (LC-RAKEL) was proposed. Firstly, the collected text data were preprocessed. Secondly, text features have been selected using the method based on Information Gain (IG) and the text feature weights were calculated using the method based on Category Discrimination (CD). Finally, the label correlations were calculated, the label pairs with higher correlation were selected to form the label subsets and the LC-RAKEL multi-label text classification model was constructed to realize classification. In the paper, the label subsets were selected based on label correlation, which could avoid the problem of random label subsets in RAKEL affecting classification accuracy. The proposed method has been tested on agricultural texts and the experimental results showed that the average precision is 91.19%, verifying the effectiveness of the proposed method. © 2019, Asian Association for Agricultural Engineering.

The results showed that the gel strength, springiness and water holding capacity of fish balls increased steadily with the amount of soy protein isolate added increasing, and the resilience of fish balls was increased to the maximum level (7 492.85 g) by adding 4% soy protein isolate while the rest was lower than the control. Compared with the control, the adhesiveness of fish balls was significantly decreased by incorporating different proportions of soy protein isolate. The incorporation of soy protein isolate also slightly reduced the cohesiveness of fish balls from 0.84 (soy protein isolate-free fish balls) to 0.82 (all fish balls incorporated with soy protein isolate). The protein denaturation temperature of the control was 100.49°C, and that of soy protein isolate-containing fish balls increased with the amount of soy protein isolate increasing, till the maximum value (107.23°C) was reached at 8% soy protein isolate. The results of SEM and FTIR showed that the number of disulfide bonds on the surface of surimi proteins gradually increased with the amount of soy protein isolate increasing, and as a result, the surface microstructure of the fish balls was improved. In conclusion, the optimal proportion of soy protein isolate added into fish balls is 4% (gel strength of 2501 N/cm2, water holding capacity of 96.28% and protein denaturation temperature of 99.59°C). © 2019, Asian Association for Agricultural Engineering.

The operation of sensors needs to be accurately studied in order to correct the design of sensor models accurately carry out the initial calibration of the ready-made sensors. The stand for investigating the sensitive elements of the gas flow rate sensors, in which the hot-wire anemometric and the calorimetric measurement modes are used, is described. It is shown that the facilities of the automatic control of the gas flow rate and dynamic recording of the measurement results make it possible to process and record the results in millisecond time intervals, investigate the operation of sensitive elements in the pulse mode, and simulate the operation of a microprocessor-based signal processing circuit at the hardware and software levels. The proposed stand makes it possible to take measurements at different gas temperatures and ambient temperatures ranging from –40 to 60°С and control the atmospheric pressure, and it makes it possible to specify the gas flow rate within 0–119 L/min. The considered stand is designed to develop compact sensors of the natural gas flow rate, which could replace the diaphragm flowmeters of the G1.6, G2.5, and G4 series.

Determining the locations and optimizing the routes for centralized rice drying in cold regions (cold rice) are important logistic system problems associated with the instant drying of rice. Because the ideal rice drying time in cold regions is 4-8 hours after harvest and should not exceed 8 hours, we established a location-routing problem (LRP) model with a time window to study this issue. We used a two-stage method that combined a greedy heuristic algorithm and an intelligent optimization algorithm to solve the problem. In the location-allocation problem (LAP) stage, the P-median model was established, and the optimal position of the drying center was determined via a greedy heuristic algorithm. Then, the solution was implemented in the vehicle-routing problem (VRP) phase. Based on clustering analysis, a multiple drying center VRP with a farmer's time window (MDVRPTW) was established. A genetic algorithm was used to solve for the optimal transportation route and minimum cost. Simulation experiments were used to verify the validity and accuracy of the model and algorithm. © 2019, Asian Association for Agricultural Engineering. All rights reserved."

Mint was treated in four ways: 0.5 μL/L of 1-MCP, low oxygen (6% O2: 9% CO2: 85% N2), 0.5 μL/L of 1-MCP with low oxygen (6% O2: 9% CO2: 85% N2) and the control (CK). And then stored for 12 days at 4°C. The results showed that the synergistic effect of 1-MCP combined with low oxygen, which caused the terpene substances (caryophyllene, D-limonene), ketones (D-carvone), esters and chlorophyll in the aroma components of mint was significantly slowed down, inhibited the conversion of alcohols (dihydrocarveol, cis-carveol) and reduced the respiratory intensity of mint. After storage for 12 days, the terpene in the mint treated with 1-MCP + low oxygen was about 30.23%, the ketone was about 33.86%, which was significantly higher than those in CK group (18.86% and 23.32%), while alcohols accounted for only 34.28%, which was significantly lower than CK group (44.82%), and the content of esters was always at a low level (0.44%-0.69%) and different treatments had little effect on them. Therefore, both 1-MCP and low oxygen can improve the quality of mint during storage. However, when 1-MCP is combined with low oxygen, it can better maintain the quality of mint, reduce the loss of volatile components, inhibit bad odor and prolong its shelf life. © 2019, Asian Association for Agricultural Engineering.

When modeling the heat transfer in nanocomposites, it is important to take into account that heat dissipation in multilayer structures with the size of layers of the order of the mean free path of the energy carriers (phonons and electrons) occurs not in the lattice but at the boundaries (interfaces) of the layers. In this regard, the use of classical numerical models based on the Fourier law is limited, causing significant errors. To obtain more accurate results, we use a model in which the heat distribution is assumed to be constant inside the layer, and the temperature changes stepwise at the boundaries of the layers. A hybrid approach is used for these calculations: the finite-difference method with an implicit time approximation scheme and a mesh-free model based on a set of radial-basis functions for the spatial approximation. The parameters of the bases are calculated by solving the systems of linear algebraic equations. In this case, only the weights of neuroelements with fixed centers and widths are chosen. As approximators, the set of frequently used basis functions is considered. To increase the speed of the calculations, the algorithm is parallelized. The computation time is evaluated to assess the performance gain with the use of the parallel implementation of the method. © 2019, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd."

During the procedure, some circumstances may arise due to social factors and other phenomena that confuse reasoning. Other related non-medical problems may emerge. Oddly enough, this tangle of suspense is revealed. The scientific novelty of the study is that the situational diagnosis is considered as a way of learning the problems of phenomena. The leading one is medical, since all this procedure begins with a search for a medical diagnosis. At this moment, other phenomena related to social, legal and other issues are “diagnosed”. This phenomenon ultimately acts as a new methodology in medical practice-situational ways of medical diagnosis. Materials and methods were based on clinical situations based on 12 demonstrations.

It caused poor nutrition and so attracted various parties concerning, thus, various researches have been done. The study objective is to assess the willingness to preserve wisdom, managing a natural farming system as a natural local food source through available potential and owned farmers. The expected study achievement is the willingness to preserve the natural farming system as a natural food source. The descriptive analysis method with a weighted average formula was adapted using the basic concept of willingness to preserve in natural farmers of Morotai Island paddy fields farming. The results concluded that there is wisdom in managing the natural farming system of natural rice in various fields as a local food natural source on Morotai Island, North Maluku, Indonesia. Farmers tended to maximize internally and minimize external inputs that characterize all farming movements so that their wisdom concept has been maintained to this day. The natural farming system wisdom, as a technological model in managing field rice as a natural local food source, produced a variety food sources like natural rice, cassava, sweet potatoes, various banana varieties, various types and sources of sago flour, vegetables, and processed marine protein sources and also consumed with various patterns without synthetic chemistry from input-process-output stage. Moreover, it concluded that Morotai Island border region farmers are willing to preserve natural farming system in paddy fields based on natural farming principles including permanent natural land without synthetic chemicals, in farming continue to choose natural seeds to use without genetic engineering, natural food sources for safe food consumption availability throughout time, and straw, as an input of natural material to restore land fertility level naturally. Therefore, the natural farming system is a natural food source, which ensures the input, process, and output are safe consumption of synthetic chemical-free economic and cultural values that cannot be found in any agricultural system. © 2019, Asian Association for Agricultural Engineering.

In this work, through ab-initio calculations, we discovered that a BiTeCl-dominant BiTeCl/Bi2Te3 heterostructure can give rise to the observed band structures with a single surface Dirac fermion. Interestingly, we further suggest that such a BiTeCl/Bi2Te3 heterostructure could be naturally formed by annealing pure BiTeCl single crystals.

AZRF (Arctic zone of the Russian Federation) occupies significant areas of the country. Its active infrastructural development is justified not only by the rich natural resources, but also by the additional strategic logistic opportunities that are being open for the Russian economy. This way, the system of servicing the “Arctic infrastructure” was developed by Technical Committee for Standardization No. 187 “Conducting research in the polar regions” requires, in turn, the solution of a number of strategic tasks related to the “polar work” – economic and regulatory including research activities in the Arctic, taking into account its inaccessibility and extreme climate. The development of complex of Arctic standards is a necessary step in the implementation of successful activities in the Russian Arctic.

The origin and evolution of the Asian monsoon (AM) from the region of its formation in the western Indian Ocean to the penetration to Northern Asia have been analyzed. It has been shown that the indices of the Indian Ocean dipole, El Niño, and the North Pacific indices were in phases that contributed not only to maximization of its intensity, but also to the fastest possible movement of the AM from the region of origin through the Indian subcontinent, Southeast Asia, and China to the Russian Far East. Due to the current composition of the climate indices in the Indian and Pacific oceans, the overwetted monsoon air mass brought the minimum possible loss of precipitation on its way to the final region. Increased monsoon precipitation in the vast catchment of the Amur river was facilitated by the fact that the Arctic Oscillation was in the negative phase, which led to the transfer of cold arctic air into the region. The latter circumstance influenced an increase in precipitation through the mechanism of accelerated condensation in humid air. Negative values of the North Pacific indices contributed to the development of blocking situations in the zonal current of temperate latitudes, which localized the zone of precipitation. © 2019, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd."

Lake ecosystems that undergo regime shifts (clear water phase, phytoplankton dominated changed into turbid water, macrophytes dominated or vice versa) are characterized by a series of transformation in trophic structure. Although previous studies have mainly focused on the causes and consequences of regime shifts in shallow lakes, studies about responses of energy flow changes to regime shifts is far from complete. In this paper, we estimated trophic position and benthivory (i.e. degree of benthivory) of seventeen fish species from seven shallow lakes. Our data show that the trophic position and benthivory of fish species in clear water phase are significantly higher than in turbid water.

Paddy soil is very different from both fluid medium and dry soil, which brings some difficulties to relevant research. In this paper, the Discrete Element Method (DEM) was used to analyze the interaction between machine components and paddy soil. The component surface was designed by mimicking the micro morphology of Ctenopharyngodon idellus fish scale. The contact models between paddy soil and component surface were built. Based on these models, comparative experiments were carried out between bionic and smooth samples. The results showed that the bionic surfaces had great drag reduction performance. Then, the mechanism of drag reduction was analyzed. The existence of crescent-like units could change tracks of soil particles and help form a lubrication film on the component surface, and the frictional resistance was reduced consequently. The DEM simulation results showed that the fish scales with crescent-like architectures could achieve a maximum of 3.68% drag reduction compared with smooth surfaces. Finally, samples were manufactured by using the computerized numerical control (CNC) method and being tested in a paddy channel. The experiment results showed that the maximum drag reduction rate of 4.78% appeared at the speed of 0.6 m/s.

The ""my right"" end of the false choice has been confusing, because it portrays obligations as rights. Further, it rhetorically attempts to grant a right where none exists. Of central concern is the question of authority and from where it arises. With the proffered death of God comes the death of any transcendent set of propositions about right and wrong. Every person then becomes a ""godlet"" being tempted to exert authority over other godlets, prompting the response, ""Sez who?"" The claim that ""healthcare is a right"" strives to redefine the terms of authority in healthcare but must answer the same question, ""Sez who?"" Efforts to anchor a right to healthcare in posited law fail because there is no such right either explicitly or implicitly enumerated in the Constitution. Further, the stretch to ground a right to healthcare as ""inalienable"" also fails because inalienable rights (life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness) are not forced but rather protected. The Affordable Care Act of 2010 attempted to force such a right through mandatory purchase of insurance - and so unraveled. Appeals to this right based on ""moral obligation"" are laudable but fall back to the same question, ""Sez who?"" The Natural Law, as a transcendent ought pulls from within every civilization and system of thought - and answers such a question not as human right but as human obligation. The Natural Law, as the common moral ground therefore has the gravitas to command our allegiance and be the authoritative foundation for healthcare reform.

The investigations are carried out directly on the chips of power microwave transistors manufactured on the GaN/AlGaN/GaN/SiC heterostructures. The ohmic fired contacts are formed with the use of Ti–Al–Mo–Au and Ti–Al–Ni–Au compositions. The microrelief of the surface on the interface of the fired contact/AlGaN and the defects formed on it is investigated in order to estimate the structural features of the contact areas. It is found that the resistance of the source and drain regions are determined to a considerable extent by the microstructure of the surface on the boundary. The formation of the conductive layer in AlGaN under an ohmic fired contact is shown by the experiments. The possibility of the formation of a new type of structural defect with a high aspect ratio in the contact and active areas of the devices at the formation of ohmic fired contacts is demonstrated. It is shown that the existence of high densities of such defects results in an increase of the leakage currents of the devices. © 2019, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd."

The theoretical analysis has resulted in the model of the morphological pattern development for thermokarst plains with fluvial erosion, which has been empirically tested at a few key sites. The analysis has allowed us to conclude that the theoretical results on the exponential distribution of khasyrei areas are confirmed empirically in different physicogeographical, geological, and geocryological environments and that the distribution of the areas of thermokarst lakes within thermokarst plains with fluvial erosion obey both gamma- and lognormal distributions. It is shown that the distribution of average radii and diameters of the khasyreis should be the Rayleigh distribution. This analysis indicates that the variant of the synchronous start of thermokarst processes is the most common at the sites under consideration. The model also allows us to assess dynamic parameters of the processes using the landscape metrics of a single time slice. © 2019, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd."

According to the management needs of modern greenhouses, this paper designed and implemented an Internet of Things strawberry disease early warning system based on association rules aiming at current diseases in ordinary strawberry greenhouses. The system was divided into three parts: greenhouse environment data collection, intelligent decision-making and information interaction. The sensors were reasonably distributed in the greenhouse to collect environmental parameters. The system first collected greenhouse environment data and smoothed the singular data. The environment data were then uploaded to the cloud server. On the other hand, based on the data mining technology of association analysis, the knowledge base of growth suitability and the rule base of disease pre-judgment required for strawberry production were obtained. The system made decision reasoning based on the knowledge rule base and the collected information. Finally, the strawberry in the user’s greenhouse was monitored in real-time and provided disease warning and solution through the APP. The system has been successfully deployed in a common plastic greenhouse in Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, China. The test results showed that the system ran smoothly and can be used for early warning. Three relatively independent parts of the system improved system scalability and maintainability.

For all the data series considered, the trends are insignificant; in this case, an increased CO content was observed in 2010, and an increasing trend of the minimum values of CO was observed in recent years (2014–2017). Both stations (Novolazarevskaya and Arrival-Heights) are characterized by an excess of satellite data over ground-based measurement data (19% and 14%, respectively); here, a seasonal dependence of the deviation was observed with minimal deviations in December–January. Data of surface measurements of the total content at st. Novolazarevskaya and Arrival-Heights are rather well consistent, and the average deviation since 2010 was 2.4%.

However, research on these differences in the pre-retirement (55-64 years) and retirement (65-80 years) age population is relevant from the scientific and practical point of view. Social exclusion of the older people can vary because of different employment, education, freedom of expression, participation in community life, connection with nature, and other possibilities. In order to reduce the social exclusion of the elderly, it is important to understand the characteristics and scope of the exclusion in different environments. The potential of society is limited by time and space. After retirement, many workers are, in fact, left outside the active sphere of life. The proportion of age-related workers remains significant and it is not always possible for them to exercise their rights and work until they become physically incapable. The novelty of the researchh lies in the formation of the concept of increasing the social potential of the older generation based on the identification of life strategies and preferences. The authors analyze the life attitudes of the older generation and identify the concept of credibility of the state. The authors note that credibility of the state should be based on uniform trust in the state at different ages, which forms an integral picture of the ongoing social contact between the state and the population. The practical significance of the study is determined by the possibility of applying the results in state development programs. The authors display that the central meaning should be given to aligning positions regarding the admissibility of a social contract in various groups of population. © Rushing Water Publishers Ltd. 2019."

In her book Świat przetłumaczony [The Translated World] (1968) Iwańska uses the figure of the translator-traitor while trying to translate Mexico conquered by the Spanish to Poland ruined by the Nazis and Stalinists—the book was the literary aftermath of her fieldwork on the culture of the Indian Mazahua of a secluded Mexican village. The scientific aftermath of the same research was her anthropological monograph Purgatory and Utopia. A Mazahua Indian Village of Mexico (1971). The first book, written in Polish, was described by the author as “a fictionalised account”, and a “literary output”; the second, written in English, was designed as “relatively free from the interference of extra-scientific emotional elements”. For Alicja Iwańska, before the Second World War a philosophy student under Władysław Tatarkiewicz, translating a culture is an ethical problem; the complex relations between truth, falsity and fiction in intercultural translation are coupled with the issues of expressibility in a specific narrative (literary versus scientific) and a specific language (Polish versus English). Iwańska’s books, read again 50 years after their creation, seem to be a forgotten link of Polish translation theory. © 2019, Komitet Słowianoznawstwa PAN. All rights reserved."

In this study, a three-component linear visco-hyperelastic model of DE film is developed based on equibiaxial tension. By applying hereditary integrals to analyze multiple-segment loading processesof film stretching, the model parameters are extracted by fitting the visco-hyperelastic film model to the experimental data. To demonstrate the performance of proposed model, the obtained predictive results are compared with the experimental results under different equibiaxial loading conditions. The good agreement between them shows that the linear visco-hyperelastic model is a promising tool for analytically investigating the property of pre-stretched DE actuators. Finally, the Prony series coefficients are calculated according to the relaxation function.

Their translators: Marianna Maliszewska, Teodor Waga, and Grzegorz Kniażewicz, added a significant amount of their own introductions and notes to the hypertext, which reflected a widespread tendency in Polish literature, both original and translated, in that period. The information given in the translators’ peritext is analysed here in order to trace manipulation within cultural mediation. The translators take different approaches. Maliszewska’s comments lack the exegetic function, while the observed elements of manipulation may be down to her deficiency in cultural competence and to her low status as a translator. Waga, who uses all kinds of translator’s notes, seems reliable and non-confrontational. His comments are mostly intended to make sure that the text is read according to the author’s intentions and to the Enlightenment outlook. Kniażewicz is the most polemical, partly towards the author of the peritext in the French version of the translated text, which he abuses rather than uses. His peritext definitely indoctrinates the reader and the extent of manipulation in his notes is the largest. © 2019, Komitet Słowianoznawstwa PAN. All rights reserved."

For the first time, craniometric characters of the genus Sylvaemus are considered in relation to the feeding ecology of species. A total of 614 skulls were studied. Based on original material, discriminant keys have been developed using skull measurements. The keys appear to be suitable for the diagnostics of the studied Sylvaemus species, including sibling ones. The largest skulls are shown to be characteristic of S.flavicollis, and the smallest ones, of S. uralensis. Cluster analysis of the absolute measurements of the skull cumulative selection has revealed the greatest isolation of S. flavicollis and the similarity of coexisting but phylogenetically remote S. ponticus and S. witherbyi. Factor analysis showed that, within the genus Sylvaemus, the general sizes are less essential than the characters related to food smashing (the length of the lower jaw and rostrum, the width of the occipital part of the skull), and possibly also to the thickness of the incisors. Comparative analyses of the relative skull measurements (the indexes related to the food preferences of the animals, granivory or folivory) allow us to conclude that the food adaptations to granivory in the structure of the skull and teeth increase in the series S. uralensis–S. sylvaticus–S. witherbyi–S. flavicollis–S. ponticus. The cranial evolution in species within the genus Sylvaemus is suggested to have been directed to increased adaptations in the mechanisms in seed peeling and processing. © 2019, Pleiades Publishing, Inc."

Informational biases occur from the distorted context when an expert witness knows which specific finding is present and the severity of the injury sustained as a result of the undiagnosed finding. Systemic litigation biases occur from the selection and undersampling of opinions and issues with compensation and affiliation between the expert and parties to litigation. Blinding the expert witness to outcomes holds potential for mitigating these biases and may act as a screening tool to evaluate civil claims. The more complex strategies of blinding the expert to both the legal case and the commissioning legal party, by providing a ""library of imaging"" for review to imitate a normal day's work, are unlikely to be practical for Australian legal practice. The persuasiveness of blinded expert evidence in mediation, concurrent evidence and court decisions in Australia is still uncertain."

This paper presents information concerning the impact of the environment on the structure of European badger family groups. Data of the authors’ own observations conducted at ten model sites in the years 2011–2018 were used as the study material. The model badger settlements studied are located on the Oka–Don Plain within the administrative borders of Saratov oblast. The results of route surveys, photo trap surveys, and correlation assessment revealed a direct and strong correlation of the area occupied by a family group and the size of the group’s forage territory to the number of individuals in the group (r = 0.875 and r = 0.715, respectively). Family groups of four types (group, polygynic, monogamous, and incomplete families) were distinguished. The group type of family is formed in areas most appropriate for the badger when the amount of available food is sufficient. Large family groups inhabit such sites and construct complex systems of burrows used by many generations of badgers. Polygynic families occupy territories similar to the first type, but characterized by a small size of the forage area. Since food availability is a limiting factor, these social systems do not develop into large family groups and consist of a polygynic family of an alpha male and several females with their offspring. A small area of the family territory and a large forage area are characteristic of the social groups of the third type. A small size of the territory available is also a limiting factor, which prevents the animals from forming social groups larger than a monogamous family. The fourth type of family groups called the incomplete family is formed under an insufficient size of the territory available combined with a small size of the forage area. Quantitatively, groups of this type include a single individual and, less often, a pair of animals. These types are not permanent structures, but rather replace each other under the influence of environmental factors. The development of a family group is limited by the total size of the area suitable for vital activity and by the amount of available food resources, which is a solution to the problem of resource allocation among animals of the species studied. © 2019, Pleiades Publishing, Inc."

These accounts were printed in Latin or Italian, and soon translated into other languages. In Poland, in the first three decades of the seventeenth century, more than a dozen reports from China, Japan, Vietnam, and Tibet were printed. They provide first eye-witness accounts from these territories, not only in Poland, but in Europe at large. Polish translations offer material for various kinds of analysis. This article discusses the work of two Polish translators, members of the Society of Jesus, who used different strategies depending on their intended target readership. Szymon Wysocki was interested mainly in religious aspects of the missions to the Far East, and he edited out most of the culture-specific items, as his writing was dedicated to young adepts of the Society. Fryderyk Szembek, on the other hand, paid attention also to cultural aspects of the accounts he translated. However, his attitude towards cultural otherness was less neutral than in the source texts. His translations constituted an important source of knowledge for the seventeenth-century Polish reader. Both translators had to cope with challenges such as proper names or culturally marked vocabulary and with the genre specificity of these texts, which were new to the Polish literary system. In my research, I use the methodological framework of polysystem theory, Lefevere’s theory of rewriting, and Pym’s concepts in the history of translation. I also refer to translation sociology, theory of reportage, history of culture, and history of languages. © 2019, Komitet Słowianoznawstwa PAN. All rights reserved."

The mechanical and biological effects of the distinctive bill structure in the parakeet auklet have been analyzed. The oral slit is concave; therefore, equilibrium is achieved without the need for disabling the posterior or anterior parts of the dorsal adductor of the lower jaw and the adductor can act with the maximal force regardless of the position of the object clamped in the bill. Shearing of large food objects, such as polychaetes and jellyfish, by the parakeet auklet bill is a jaw apparatus specialization unique among birds. Strengthening of the jaw apparatus, which was initially adapted for capturing small planktonic crustaceans, involved the development of additional aponeuroses in the internal adductor, consolidation of the latter, shortening of the bill, and changes of the shape of the oral slit opening. © 2019, Pleiades Publishing, Inc."

Its lubricant free friction and wear are tested at room temperature on a tribometer under a load of 20 N, at a roundabout motion of a ruby ball penetrator on a disk. The nanohardness and elastic modulus of the nanocomposite are determined via kinetic indentation. The fracture surface structure and friction track are monitored using a scanning electron microscope. The microstructure in the bulk of the nanocomposite was probed via dark- and bright-field transmission electron microscopy scanning of thin foils. The thermal stability of graphene was monitored via Raman spectroscopy. The introduction of graphene is shown to improve micro- and nanohardness, elasticity, and wear resistance by two to three orders of magnitude, as well as to slightly decrease the coefficient of friction. A graphene content of 2 wt % alters the mechanism of wear from brittle fracture to viscous shear owing to stronger coupling of matrix grains and the presence of agglomerates. A lack of degradation and the retention of graphene thermal stability are evidenced as well. The morphology of graphene particles reveals their preferential arrangement inside the corundum grains rather than at the grain boundaries. © 2019, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd."

In the Red Data Book of the Russian Federation, the Mednyi Arctic fox is listed as an endangered species. The model developed is based on data collected over 19 years of fieldwork. Annual marking of cubs in the study area allowed us to identify up to 80% of animals individually and to collect their life-history data. As a result, we identified the mortality rates of males and females of all age groups, the probabilities of breeding, litter sizes, the sex ratios of animals in different age groups, social structures, dispersion distances, and the patterns of making decisions in the selection of social partners and habitat patches. The model is spatially explicit, i.e., the heterogeneity of the habitat patches is defined in explicit form. The model works with a time step of one year. In simulations, demographic parameters such as population dynamics, population age structure, sex ratio in different age groups, and the structure and size of families conformed to the empirical data. An analysis of the model sensitivity to variations in mortality rates in different age groups showed that the sensitivity to shifts in cub mortality is much higher compared to adults of all age groups. Through increasing the cub mortality rate to 95% over a period of one to five years, we simulated the effect of the otodectic mange epizootic, which was observed in a real population of the Mednyi Arctic fox. The population recovery time after the end of the impact in the simulation was significantly longer compared to field data. We suggest that, in reality, with a low population size, the productivity of the population increases. This feedback that accelerates population recovery has not yet been introduced into the model. In conclusion, we discuss advantages of the individual-based modeling based on long-term field studies. © 2019, Pleiades Publishing, Inc."

The basis of the research is laid by the fundamental ideas of sociology, comparative analysis, and interdisciplinary approach. The theoretical study is based on the conceptual works and the results of the research by the Russian and foreign authors devoted to the analysis of the living standards, and the sociology of the city. The paper contained the results of the empirical study of the citizens’ living standards. It was established that the city is not only a territorial unit but also a subjective reality reflected in the ideas and attitude of the citizens to the city as the results of their development of the environment. The citizens based on their constructed reality choose some or other social practices, which allow them to take an active or passive part in city life. Urban space affects the living standards of the citizens, while living standards, in turn, affect the urban space. Living standards of the citizens are manifested in such indicators as safety (physical, economic and political); stability (resource and social); reproduction, formation, entrenchment and transfer of the cultural heritage and values. The paper contained the results of the empirical study of the citizens by the indicators of the living standards.

The latter was a second-person plural pronoun in Proto Austronesian, but after it had lost its plural meaning in Proto Malayo-Polynesian, it was often combined with or replaced by other pronominal extenders. In this squib I show that in East Barito languages (including Malagasy) the first-person inclusive plural pronoun also derives from a dual *kita with a second-person plural extender. Taken in conjunction with the fact that reflexes of *kita also have a dual meaning in various languages in northern Borneo, this suggests that *kita already had a dual meaning in the early history of the West Indonesian subgroup. © by University of Hawai‘i Press.

However, when the chlorine content is less than 0.5%, the mercurimetric method fails to provide sufficient accuracy, and a more sensitive method of chlorine coulometric titration by electrogenerated silver ions appears preferable. We consider the possibility of determining microgram contents of chloride ions in solutions using a digital coulometric analyzer (Expert-006 produced by Econics-Expert (Moscow)) supplemented with an electrolytic cell with silver electrodes. The coulometer was tested in different operating modes to select the optimal electrochemical parameters of ion chloride titration and develop a technique for coulometric determination of chloride ions which in combination with the preliminary burning of the analyzed substances in an oxygen-filled flask provides determination of the residual chlorine in organic matrices at a level of 0.1–0.5%. The proposed technique was used to determine the residual chlorine in a number of polymers. The relative error did not exceed 5% at chlorine concentrations of 0.16–0.28%. © 2019, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd."

The geological data indicate that the region under study was a part of the Baltica paleocontinent since the early Mesoproterozoic. The paleomagnetic data obtained for rocks of the westernmost part of the Ural Fold Belt show no evidence of local and regional rotations relative to Baltica. Consequently, the pole obtained can be extrapolated to the entire platform. The result obtained is characterized by a rather high degree of reliability and can clarify the trajectory of the apparent polar wander path (APWP) for the Baltica paleocontinent during the Late Ordovician–Early Silurian, where reliable paleomagnetic data are not available, and can be used for further paleoreconstructions. © 2019, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd."

The purpose of this article was to develop a method for synthesis of structures for active loaded block reservation of subsystems. The main method of study of this problem was the analysis method, which allowed us to develop a way for optimizing the structure of block reservation, which can significantly increase the likelihood of uptime compared to non-optimal options. Among many ways to increase the reliability of subsystems associated with the introduction of reservation to the system, this study discussed a method of increasing the reliability of subsystems with active loaded reservation by choosing the optimal block size. The task of selecting the optimal block size of reservation subsystems was set in the work. A graphical and analytical model of the reservation structure was developed using a wave algorithm for optimizing the reliability of aircraft subsystems with sudden independent element failures. A method for synthesizing the structure of block reservation was described. Examples of calculations were presented. The proposed method is applicable to any problems that can be reduced to optimization on both oriented and non-oriented weighted graphs, with the complexity not exceeding polynomial of third-order. © Rushing Water Publishers Ltd. 2019."

Usually the majority of swans crosses the territory of the agricultural landscape in transit, and only a small portion of the birds stayed in it for feeding for 1–2 days. In 2017, swans formed a mass migration stopover in the fields, 340 to 1328 individuals per day were counted on it for 11 days, the majority of which (about 90%) were Bewick’s swans. It was established that such a high concentration of swans in the fields was a result of an unfavorable ecological situation in the region at the beginning of their mass migration. The places of traditional migration stopovers in shallow waters of Lake Ladoga were closed by floating ice, and unusually cold weather in the second half of April and ice-covered water bodies in the northern part of the migratory route hindered the migration of birds to their breeding grounds. In the current situation, the swans were forced to look for new places of feeding and concentrated in the most favorable (for this purpose) grounds of the agricultural landscape. © 2019, Pleiades Publishing, Inc."

Owls have a number of species-specific microstructural primary remex characteristics that are taxonomically important. First of all, these are the structural features of the pennaceous barb, which differ markedly not only at the ordinal, but also at the species level: cross-section configuration, pith architectonics in cross- and longitudinal sections, and cuticular barb structures. This work emphasizes that the identified elements are of taxonomic significance only when comparing the specific, strictly analogous sections of the barbs in different bird species. Based on the present study, we conclude that along with the typical elements of feather architectonics characteristic of representatives of other bird orders, the owls show a number of peculiar microstructural features. Thus, as the result of an analysis of the microstructure of the owls primary remex pennaceous barb vanule, the unique features of the distal barbules and the structure of the apical section of the barb with tightly adjacent and elongate proximal and distal barbules could be distinguished. These characteristics are revealed to cause a dense fleecy structure of the vane dorsal surface and the presence of a complex of peculiar “bunches” that form the cleft edge, i.e., the purely specific traits of the owls feather that are not found in representatives of any other bird orders we have investigated. © 2019, Pleiades Publishing, Inc."

Therefore, it is necessary in conducting experiments to surmount this disadvantage and make a possibility in enhancing the color quality of WLEDs with remote phosphor structure. In this research, with the ability of advancing the color rendering index (CRI) and color quality (CQS) for WLEDs, a dual-layer remote phosphor structure was considered as a suggestion. The experiments in this study used three kinds of WLEDs with the similar structures but different color temperatures varying at 5600 K, 7000 K, and 8500 K. The objectives of this paper is proposing a solution to obtain the highest color quality by placing a yellow-green emitting SrBaSiO4:Eu2+ phosphor layer or a red-emitting SrwFxByOz:Eu2+, Sm2+ phosphor layer on the YAG:Ce3+ phosphor layer and then choosing the most appropriate value of SrwFxByOz:Eu2+, Sm2+ concentration. The experimental results which are satisfied expectations of researchers indicated that SrwFxByOz:Eu2+, Sm2+ has enforced its role in managing to raise the CRI and CQS. Particularly, the greater concentration of SrwFxByOz:Eu2+, Sm2+ leads to the higher the CRI and CQS, since the red light component in WLEDs increased. Besides, the quality of luminous flux is in a tight connection with the SrBaSiO4:Eu2+ phosphor layer. Whereas, according to the Mie scattering theory and the Lambert-Beer law, if the concentration of SrwFxByOz:Eu2+, Sm2+ and SrBaSiO4:Eu2+ becomes redundant, the luminous flux and color quality will take a deep dive. Briefly, the results from this article has largely contributed to fabricating high-quality WLEDs. © 2019 Universitas Ahmad Dahlan. All rights reserved."

Complexes are isostructural, crystallize in sp. gr. P21/n with Z = 4. The Zn2+ ion has a distorted tetrahedral coordination with two S or Se atoms and two O atoms from ehpt or ehps, respectively. In vitro, insulin-mimetic activities of [Zn(ehpt)2] and [Zn(ehps)2] are much higher than that of Zn complex with maltol, 3-hydroxy-2-methyl-4H-pyran-4-one, [Zn(hmpo)2]}, where Zn coordination is completed by H2O molecules. It suggests that Zn complexes with distorted tetrahedral coordination might exhibit higher insulin-mimetic activities than those with octahedral or square pyramidal coordination. © 2019, Pleiades Publishing, Inc."

With the increasing number of staffs and students, the food court has quickly become very congested especially during peak hours such as lunch. Occasionally, long queues can still be found even the food court is not at its peak hours. This is not a good sign as it will cause more customers to be impatient, and more challenges arise to the food court. BreakTime is introduced to improve the situation for food court in universities and colleges. The proposed web-based system will be used by three different users; System Administrator, Food Court Stall’s Representative and Customers.

Understandably enough, the editorial efforts serve to ensure the quality and reception of the text, and range from publisher’s pressure and copyediting to aesthetic (or societal) patronage and complementary efforts to append the text with critical commentary. The article juxtaposes the intimacy of the translation process with the inherently intrusive role of an editor, foregrounding the fragile psychological balance which preconditions effective collaboration and long-term commitment. Finally, the article discusses the need for editorial policies attuned to Shakespeare in translation, which would take into account both the literary intricacy of the original(s) and the specificity of retranslation dialectics, with the necessary positioning of new rewritings against past canon(s). © 2019, Komitet Słowianoznawstwa PAN.

By means of solving the system of differential equations at each step of integration, the vector of unknown currents and voltages across circuit elements during the transient process can be obtained. As a result, the steady-state mode of power supply operation is attained. This mode can be also obtained when solving the boundary problem. In this case, discretization of the system of differential equations is carried out at the integration step and, then, the system of algebraical equations through the whole period of a steady-state mode is written. The solution of this sparse matrix with a regular structure allows one to determine all the unknown quantities in the circuit in the steady-state mode. An additional equation, which can be expressed in terms of circuit voltages and currents, is introduced in this system of equations, e.g., the equation of power released in the load at a given resistor resistance. The solution of the unified system allows one to obtain both the load resistance and the whole vector of voltages and currents, which correspond to this parameter. © 2019, Allerton Press, Inc."

METHODS: Forty premolar surfaces were allocated to four groups of 10/ each, 20/buccal and 20/lingual surfaces. The brackets were bonded to the surface of the enamel and any extra adhesive was removed with a dental explorer or a micro brush. Specimens were evaluated and scored by two calibrated independent raters, at the bracketadhesive-enamel junction, for adhesive overlap on the bracket, the smoothness of the surface, as well as the presence of projections and depressions, using a digital microscope. The Fisher-exact statistical test was conducted to compare the different groups. RESULTS: Regardless of the method used to remove the adhe sives, all groups showed partial or complete overlap of the adhesive on the bracket. No statistical difference was found between the groups for adhesive overlap (P=1.0). However, resin-modified glass-ionomer was found to be statistically significantly (P<0.05) better than composite resin in both smoothness and the lack of projections or depressions, regardless of the instrument of removal. CONCLUSION: Removing excess adhesive with a dental explorer or a micro brush is not an ideal method for adhesive removal, as partial or complete overlap of the adhesive on the bracket existed in all groups. On the other hand, resin-modified glassionomer was a superior material to composite resin for better smoothness and surface topography at the bracket-adhesive-enamel junction.

Previously, we demonstrated that the propensity to social dominance in male laboratory mice is mainly determined by an individual’s genotype. However, it remains unclear whether genotypic peculiarities of mouse olfactory communication, the most important links of which are marking behavior and olfactory contacts, are associated with the ability to occupy a high social rank in the hierarchical structure of the community? The aim of the present work was to establish the effect of genotype on the intensity of marking behavior and olfactory contacts in male laboratory mice in a social competition model and to study the association of these types of social behavior with a hereditary predisposition to dominance. This study was conducted on adult males of inbred mice strains BALB/cLac, CBA/Lac, and PT differing in the propensity to dominate: BALB/cLac and PT males mainly dominated CBA/Lac males. The experimental groups were formed out of two males of different genotypes in three possible pairwise combinations. The intensity of urine marking the territory was estimated for each male in conditions of social isolation and after pair keeping during the period of stable dominant–subordinate relations. Olfactory contacts that were naso-nasal and naso-anogenital sniffing were used as an additional indicator of the propensity of mice to olfactory communication in conditions of social competition. Hereditary differences in the intensity of urine marking and in the frequency of olfactory contacts were established in male laboratory mice in the social competition model: dominant males of the CBA/Lac strain marked the territory and sniffed the opponent more frequently than dominants of the BALB/cLac and PT strains, while a decrease in urine marking and olfactory activity was observed in subordinate males of these strains. During social isolation, males of the CBA/Lac strain also marked the territory more frequently than males of the two other strains. Thus, the male mice of different inbred strains differ in the intensity of urine marking and olfactory behavior, which can be modified by external conditions, for example, social rank of an individual, and the intensity of urine marking and olfactory activity does not predict the social rank of an individual. © 2019, Pleiades Publishing, Inc."

The surface microlayer is about 50 μm thick. The special microbial community formed here is referred to as neuston. The total bacterial abundance in the surface microlayer (SML) and underlying waters (UW) of Lake Baikal was studied by epifluorescence microscopy. The physicochemical features of the surface microlayer of Lake Baikal have been established for the first time. SML was sampled throughout all of Lake Baikal in May–June of 2013–2016 and in August of 2013, 2015, and 2016. SML samples were taken from a boat with Garret’s metal mesh screen (26.5 cm in diameter) mostly in calm weather. The average values of total bacterial abundance in SML varied from year to year within the range of (0.93–1.49) × 106 cells/mL in May–June and (1.73–2.24) × 106 cells/mL in August; in the UW (at a depth of about 15–20 cm), these values were 0.79–0.89 × 106 cells/mL in May–June and 1.15–1.4 × 106 cells/mL in August. There was a significant difference and direct relationship between the total abundances of neuston and plankton bacteria of Lake Baikal in the summer period. The differences in chemical composition between the surface microlayer and the subsurface water layer were revealed in all the seasons under study. The surface microlayer was enriched in PO-3 4, total organic carbon, and suspended particulate matter compared to the underlying water layers. There was a direct relationship between bacterial numbers in the surface microlayer and the concentration of suspended particulate matter. © 2019, Pleiades Publishing, Inc."

Eversmann, N.A. Zarudnyi, and P.P. Sushkin among others. In most cases, the scientists based their assumptions on circumstantial evidence alone, for instance, summer records of adult birds and migrating broods. Taking into account the specific biology of the species in question, such data could not be regarded as sufficient proof for the species’ nesting. In the middle of the 20th century, these data were revised and quite justly criticized: this led to varying conclusions regarding the nesting of tundra wader species in the region as having been wrong. The matter seemed to be settled. Yet it should be noted that, along with circumstantial data on the nesting of northern waders, the early researchers had also reported very solid facts like finding nests with clutches of eggs and nonflying chicks (including the Red-necked Phalarope and the Little Stint). For certain reasons, those facts were not considered during the revision that followed. Firstly, it was difficult to find an explanation for such outstanding evidence in the middle of the 20th century. Secondly, no new nests of those species were found that could confirm the 19th century researchers as having been right. Furthermore, the idea that long-term cycles of climate changes influence the dynamics of bird nesting areas became widely accepted only by the end of the 20th century. Nowadays when this idea has been thoroughly developed, the possibility of the former nesting of some tundra wader species in arid regions does not seem so incredible. It seems likely that Zarudnyi and Sushkin were the last scientists to witness the nesting of tundra wader populations in the Orenburg region as over time due to climate warming the waders might have left the region for good. © 2019, Pleiades Publishing, Inc."

By using the examples of delphinidin-3-O-glucoside and pelargonidine-3-O-glucoside, it is shown that only dihydroxylated forms of anthocyanins are capable of forming a complex with Al3+, while non-hydroxylated anthocyanins form no similar complexes. In the selected conditions, the total contents of dihydroxylated anthocyanins in wines made from different grape varieties (calculated for cyanidin-3-O-glucoside) are determined, which vary for red wines from 8.7 mg/dm3 for Cabernet (Kuban Vine) to 27.1 mg/dm3 for wine made from the Saperavi grape variety. The highest contents of these forms of anthocyanins have been obtained for wines made from the grape varieties of Saperavi, Krasnostop, and Cabernet. To determine the relationship between dihydroxylated anthocyanins and monomeric forms, the total content of monomeric forms of anthocyanins in the studied wines is determined by pH-differential spectrophotometry. It has been found that the share of these forms of anthocyanins in the total content of monomeric forms was 9–14%. A high degree of correlation between the total contents of dihydroxylated and monomeric forms of anthocyanins has been obtained (rc = 0.98; rt = 0.63 for n = 10; α = 0.05). The relationships between the total contents of anthocyanins (both monomeric and dihydroxylated) and spectral characteristics (color intensity and nuance) have been determined as is recommended by the OIV (International Organization of Vine and Wine) to estimate the quality of wines. It is shown that wines with the highest content of dihydroxylated and monomeric forms of anthocyanins are characterized by higher color intensities. © 2019, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd."

These resources cannot function without communicating with each other properly making management of such information an important factor in organizational performance. This study is set to examine the cause of an event that triggers organisational performance through information dissemination and management. The problem of mismanagement of information between faculties and staff as well as the spread of distorted information or ‘manufactured lies’ is a thing of concern in the University setting. While other researchers have worked on the technical aspect of information management, this study focused on the managerial aspect of information dissemination. The paper adopts a survey research approach to the discussion of issues raised in order to put up a position of how information is disseminated and managed in the Nigerian university. The study established that information management is distinctively different from information technology. While investment in information technology has not yielded the corresponding impact on organisational performance, investment in information management has positively influenced organisational performance. The thrust of this paper is, therefore, to raise awareness and expand our knowledge of the need to improve information management in the institution of higher learning that can increase better performance in order to help in achieving the vision and mission of the institution. © 2019, Hampstead Psychological Associates.

This problem is related to the optimal foraging theory. According to U. Dieckmann’s suggestion, the population distribution by patches should be modeled according to the utility function that takes into account the amount of resources per patch, the population–patch distance, and the extent to which the population is aware of the amount of resources in the patch. In this case, the population distribution by patches is described using the Boltzmann distribution. Dieckmann considers a static problem without taking into account the change in the position of the population over time. In this paper, we suggest a dynamic system that describes the population distribution by patches, which depends on the utility of patches that changes over time as a result of variations in the population–patch distance. That said, the Boltzmann distribution is a particular solution of the derived system of ordinary differential equations. The Lyapunov stability condition for the Boltzmann distribution is derived. The patch utility functions dependent on the distance to and the population’s awareness of the patch are introduced. As a result, in the 2D case the R2 space in divided in preferential utility domains. This partition generalizes G.F. Voronoy’s diagram. © 2019, Allerton Press, Inc."

In this paper, a novel approach of hole position correction using laser line scanner (LLS) is proposed to assign a single row of holes on the parts' surfaces. First, we adopt a space circle fitting method and the random sample consensus (RANSAC) to obtain the precise coordinates of center of the datum holes' coordinates. Second, LLS is calibrated by the laser tracker, and the relations between the LLS coordinate system and the tool coordinate system (TCS) can be calculated. Third, the kinematics model of the automatic riveting machine is established based on a two-point referencing strategy proposed in this paper. Thus, the positions of the holes to be drilled can be adjusted. Finally, the experimental results show that in TCS the measurement error of LLS is less than 0.1 mm, and the correction error of the hole position is less than 0.5 mm, which demonstrates the reliability of our method. © 2019, Editorial Department of Transactions of NUAA.

A total of 478 skulls of Sylvaemus specimens were measured and analyzed. Cluster analysis of skull measurements showed that both S. uralensis and S. flavicollis could be split into two groups, the northern and the southern ones, which completely correspond to the genetically described intraspecific structure of S. flavicollis, but only partly in regards to S. uralensis. The northern and southern groups of both species are distinguished for the first time using discriminant analysis. Indices (relative skull measurements) related to the character of feeding are discussed. The intraspecific craniometric variability of S. flavicollis is suggested to be related to distinctions in the diet and the ways of getting food, whereas for S. uralensis no relation between the values of the indices of the dental apparatus and feeding features in different parts of its distribution range has been revealed. © 2019, Pleiades Publishing, Inc."

Changes in the polarization and spatial distribution of the total field and magnetization are studied under ferromagnetic resonance and antiresonance conditions. It has been established that in the distribution of the amplitudes of the total microwave field and magnetization, there is both a contribution that decreases monotonically with depth and oscillations caused by spin wave interference. It is demonstrated that the wave interference is especially significant for weakly pinned spins at the film boundaries. It is established that oscillations of the angle of rotation of the polarization ellipse and ellipticity are large when the ferromagnetic antiresonance condition is satisfied. © 2019, Pleiades Publishing, Inc."

In this paper we studied the effect of social environment (the presence of conspecifics, a pair-mate, and a vocal duel), breeding period, and individuality on the acoustic variables and occurrence of self-advertising calls (trumpet calls) in male crested auklets (Aethia cristatella). This species is a planktivorous seabird that breeds in dense colonies and displays complex social behavior on the colony surface. We collected data in 2008–2010 and 2015 on Talan Island (Sea of Okhotsk); in total we used 1047 calls from 25 individually marked and 62 unmarked males. We found that the majority of males most often emit self-advertising calls when a pair-mate is absent, but other conspecifics are present; most rarely they emit self-advertising calls when a pair-mate is present, but other conspecifics are absent. However, there are some individual differences in those preferences. We suggest that, in the presence of a pair-mate, auklets prefer to use duet displays to signal their social status and pair-mate “occupation.” We also found that the effect of the social environment and breeding period on all acoustic variables measured is weaker than the effect of individuality. However, some of the trumpet call variables (mainly the duration of some syllables inside the trumpet call) changed significantly under the influence of the social environment and breeding period. Thus, crested auklets can slightly change the acoustic variables of their calls depending on the social environment, but keep the overall signature of their calls stable to make vocal individual recognition possible during the entire breeding season. © 2019, Pleiades Publishing, Inc."

Dzerzhinsky and his disciples have rendered the jaw apparatus of birds a conventional and thoroughly characterized research object for functional morphology in Russia. The author, who communicated with Dzerzhinsky for many years, attempts to reconsider his scientific heritage in a critical manner and to use it as a foundation for outlining the most promising directions of further research. The analysis shows that underestimation of the problem of muscle mass economy in the jaw apparatus, despite the critical importance of any excess ballast for birds, was a serious drawback of Dzerzhinsky’s method. A new model based on the separation of the kinematics of bill opening and food object compression provides a solution for the problem of economical use of muscle mass in the avian jaw apparatus. The length of the major jaw adductor muscles remains virtually unchanged when the bill is opened, so that these muscles act as inextensible links of the closed multilink kinematic chain of the kinetic skull. Length change upon mouth opening being unnecessary, these muscles can be short-fibered, that is, lightweight but strong. The large force of these muscles is only used by the bird when the object is fixed in the bill and the jaw joint locking mechanism is switched on; a different kinematic chain used for object compression only is formed in this case. If the nonparallel arrangement of the pterygoid muscle and the jugal bar is also taken into account, the avian capacity for using the full force potential of the jaw adductor muscles without careful adjustment to each food object and the specific conditions of food object capturing becomes easy to understand. The main elements of the proposed model, which were found out by Dzerzhinsky himself, acquire a new meaning in light of the concept of economical use of the muscle mass. This enables us to make a major generalization concerning the adaptive significance of the cranial kinesis in birds as a means of reducing the jaw adductors’ mass without decreasing their force. In addition to the new model of jaw mechanics, other promising directions are proposed for the development of Dzerzhinsky’s work based on the expansion of the set of methods. The analysis of the aponeurotic framework of jaw muscles from the standpoint of optimizing the spatial packaging of muscle fibers may be a promising topic for research based on a combination of computer tomography and computational modeling. © 2019, Pleiades Publishing, Inc."

In the conditions of intensive agriculture, the agrophytocenosis structure and features of the agricultural cultivation technology serve as key factors for the differentiation of bird communities in the steppe agricultural landscape. A relatively high specific richness characterizes bird communities of virgin pastures, while among field agrocenoses, i.e., in the areas seeded with perennial grass, the population is much poorer in the grain fields, which are prevalent in the area of agricultural landscapes and, especially, in fields of cultivated crops. During the period of agricultural stability, both the living conditions and the bird community structure in the agricultural landscape remained relatively constant from year to year. The economic crisis that took place at the end of the 20th century caused a deep decline in agricultural production, namely, a decrease in livestock and a reduction in the area of land sown. The restorative successions of vegetation in pastures and fallow lands led to significant changes in the conditions of bird habitats. For many species these changes meant an increase in the ecological capacity of the environment and contributed to the growth of their populations in the agricultural landscape (Alauda arvensis Linnaeus, 1758; Motacilla flava Linnaeus, 1758; Coturnix coturnix (Linnaeus, 1758); Tetrax tetrax (Linnaeus, 1758), etc.). The opposite tendency for reduction in numbers is demonstrated by species that avoid high closed grass stands (Melanocorypha leucoptera (Pallas, 1811), Oenanthe oenanthe (Linnaeus, 1758), and O. isabellina (Temminck, 1820), etc.). In general, the community density in the agricultural landscape increased by 2.3 times as compared to the precrisis period, and the number of nesting species increased by 1.3 times. For the species that had formed strong ecological connections with agriculture (primarily, the Corvidae family Рiса рiсa (Linnaeus, 1758); Corvus monedula Linnaeus, 1758; C. frugilegus Linnaeus, 1758; C. cornix Linnaeus, 1758), the decline in the agricultural production and the reduction of functioning agrocenoses had opposite consequences and caused the decline in their numbers in the agricultural landscape. © 2019, Pleiades Publishing, Inc."

No significant differences in the space use system of these subspecies were found. The structure of social interactions was identical in females but different in males: M. m. nogaiorum males exhibited a dominance hierarchy, while a despotic dominance was found in M. m. psammophilus males. M. m. psammophilus females also exhibited dominance hierarchy in enclosures, in addition, avoiding same-sex conspecifics seems to be a typical behavioral strategy of M. m. psammophilus. These findings support our suggestion that Tuvan–Mongolian M. m. psammophilus populations should be treated as a distinct species. © 2019, Pleiades Publishing, Inc."

At acne, an important role is played by the activity of the skin microbiota, namely: Cutibacterium acnes (former Propionobacterum acnes) and Staphylococcus spp. Various anti-microbial drugs are used in complex treatment of patients with acne. Scientific literature does not contain enough information about susceptibility of these pathogens to anti-microbials. To investigate the sensitivity of microorganisms participating in the development of acne to anti-microbials which are most commonly used for local therapy-a bacteriological study of the acne rash elements of 60 patients with acute illness was conducted. Forty strains of Staphylococcus spp. and 15 strains of C. acnes were isolated and studied. Sensitivity of microorganisms to anti-microbials was determined by the disc diffusion test and double dilution method. It was established that isolated strains exhibited low susceptibility to anti-microbials, which were commonly used in medical practice for topical acne treatment. Only 17.5% of staphylococci strains demonstrated sensitivity to erythromycin, and just 45% of them were sensitive to clindamycin. Cutibacterium acnes had a higher level of antibiotic susceptibility than staphylococci. In fact, the established data do not allow considering the drugs with those antibiotics to be high effective at treatment of acne. The isolated strains of C. acnes and Staphylococcus spp. were characterized by a high level of resistance to basic medicines (erythromycin, clindamycin, chloramphenicol, benzoyl peroxide) for local therapy of acne. There is a need to find new effective medicines for etiotropic acne treatment. © Rushing Water Publishers Ltd. 2019."

In this work, we propose to suppress such low frequency artifacts with a filter based on the geodesic distance affinity. A multispectral signal model is considered and the main idea of the proposed algorithm is based on assumption that low frequency outliers and additive noise in different image channels are uncorrelated. Thus, the affinity space formed by opposite channels can be used to efficiently suppress the Wiener filter restoration artifacts. The performance of the proposed filter is analyzed and compared in terms of the PSNR accuracy. © 2019, Pleiades Publishing, Inc."

One of the phases is the viscoplastic granular Bingham fluid; the other phase is a viscous Newtonian fluid. The equations for flows in the Hele–Shaw cell are analyzed asymptotically, i.e., when the flat-channel width is much less than its length. The correlations between the phase flow rates and the pressure gradient leading to equations of filtration for a two-phase granular viscoplastic fluid are constructed. The criterion is found for the initiation of motion of a granular phase in a porous medium. It is established that, depending on the shear-yield stress, such a phase does not flow if either the pressure gradient or the channel thickness is small. The phase flow rates are analyzed numerically at various input parameters such as the phase viscosities, phase resistivities, ultimate shear stress, etc. The factors slowing down the penetrating motion of the solid phase into the porous medium are revealed. © 2019, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd."

In cruise SO258/1 on the R/V Sonne, new data were collected using Parasound seismic profiling and a multibeam echo-sounder survey. Faults in the sedimentary cover, which extend to the bottom surface, indicate high neotectonic activity in the Osborn Plateau area. It may continue up to the present, as well as in the adjacent segment of the Ninetyeast Ridge, where strong earthquakes have been recorded. Two reflectors in the upper part of the sedimentary cover mark the global lowering of the World Ocean level at the Miocene/Pliocene and Pliocene/Pleistocene boundaries. The reflector in the sediments at the Lower/Upper Pliocene boundary is associated with a change in the regional hydrodynamic regime that occurred at that time in the eastern Indian Ocean. The rocks dredged on Osborn Plateau are identical to some volcanic rocks of the Ninetyeast Ridge, confirming their assumed genetic link, but they are more similar to the basalts of the Kerguelen Plateau. Extremely altered vitroclastic tuffs appear to have been formed as a result of explosive volcanic eruptions of alkali basalts or foidites under subaeral or relatively shallow water conditions and represent the most recent eruptions in the region. © 2019, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd."

In this paper, the traditional two-level nested linear array is improved to achieve more degrees of freedom (DOFs) and better angle estimation performance. Furthermore, a computationally efficient DOA estimation algorithm is proposed. The discrete Fourier transform (DFT) method is utilized to obtain coarse DOA estimates, and subsequently, fine DOA estimates are achieved by spatial smoothing multiple signals classification (SS-MUSIC) algorithm. Compared to SS-MUSIC algorithm, the proposed algorithm has the same estimation accuracy with lower computational complexity because the coarse DOA estimates enable to shrink the range of angle spectral search. In addition, the estimation of the number of signals is not required in advance by DFT method. Extensive simulation results testify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. © 2019, Editorial Department of Transactions of NUAA. All right reserved."

The timing of breeding events for the parakeet auklet was measured by monitoring the productivity plots on Buldir Island, and the timing of chick hatching was determined by observing birds that carried food to chicks on St. Paul Island. On Buldir Island, direct observations of birds on water were used to collect data on parakeet auklet attendance as it was impossible to count the birds directly on land because of lush vegetation covering the slope of the colony. The birds were counted on a designated plot on water below the colony. On St. Paul Island, observations of birds on both the water and the cliffs were used to collect data on parakeet auklet attendance patterns. On each count day, the birds present at the plot were counted every 15 min. Parakeet auklets have two peaks in their attendance pattern on the water near the colony on Buldir Island. As the breeding season progressed, the peak timing of birds moved slightly toward the afternoon. On St. Paul Island, prior to egg-laying, the numbers of parakeet auklets attending the breeding colony peaked in the morning. As the breeding season progressed, the peak of bird attendance at the colony broadened and shifted toward the evening. During the chick-rearing period, birds arrived at the land plot throughout the day, but there was a peak in the numbers attending in the evening. The observations showed that the weather conditions strongly influenced the numbers of birds present at the plot. Strong winds decreased the number of parakeet auklets in the nearshore area. On windy days, the birds left the plot earlier than usual. © 2019, Pleiades Publishing, Inc."

The authors have analyzed the main characteristics of thesauri published in open access for scientific research, evaluated trends of their development, and their effectiveness in solving natural language processing tasks. Statistical and linguistic methods of thesaurus construction that allow automation of their development and reduce the labor costs of expert linguists have been studied. In particular, algorithms for extracting keywords and semantic thesaurus relations of all types have been considered and the quality of the thesauri generated with the use of these tools was assessed. To illustrate features of various methods of constructing thesaurus relations, the authors developed a combined method that fully automatically generates a specialized thesaurus based on a text corpus of a selected domain and several existing linguistic resources. The proposed method was used to conduct experiments on two Russian-language text corpora that represent two different domains: articles on migration and tweets. The resulting thesauri were analyzed by means of an integrated assessment that had been developed by the authors in a previous study and allows one to determine various aspects of the analyzed thesaurus and appraise the quality of the methods of its generation. The analysis revealed the main advantages and disadvantages of various approaches to thesaurus construction and extraction of semantic relations of different types, and also made it possible to identify potential focus areas for future research. © 2019, Allerton Press, Inc."

It has been shown that the uneven vertical distribution of light, temperature, oxygen, and hydrogen sulfide creates ecological niches for the development of many various groups of microorganisms. In most lakes, the minimum abundance of microorganisms was found in the surface water layer, while its maximum was in the near-bottom layers. The trophic status of a water body has a great influence on the formation and function of microbial communities.

The content of hydrogen sulfide, the abundance of sulfate-reducing bacteria, and the rate of sulfate reduction were maximal in the bottom sediments of eutrophic lambas. © 2019, Pleiades Publishing, Inc."

This necessitates the building of different kinds of hotels. Minimal investment, territory and the need for staff allowed small hotels to occupy a large segment of the Russian hotel market. Based on this, we formed the problem of research – the lack of modern architectural typology of small hotels. The purpose of the article is to identify the features of the architectural typology of small hotels in the South of Russia. As one of the main factors constraining the development of tourism in Rostov Region, most researchers point to the absence of a sufficient number of accommodation facilities that meet modern requirements of comfort and adapted to the operational characteristics of each type of tourism. In the world of projecting and regulatory documents, there are 17 main types of small hotels which are considered in this research. Comprehensive research of the tourism sector in Rostov Region revealed the statistics of accommodation of tourists visiting the Rostov region. In the course of the research, the most common types of small hotels in Rostov Region were identified. © 2019, ASERS Publishing House. All rights reserved."

During the entire period of tracking (from November 2017 to February 2018), the seal moved only in the southeastern part of Lake Ladoga, occasionally entering the estuaries of larger rivers. These areas are highly bioproductive and have high food concentrations. Before ice formation, the seal preferred shallow coastal areas with a high anthropogenic pressure. After ice formation, the seal moved to deeper ice-free areas of the lake. © 2019, Pleiades Publishing, Inc."

Firstly, the mathematical models of the communication delay and computing delay in multi-cell cellular edge computing systems are established and expressed as virtual delay queues. Then, based on the virtual delay models, a novel joint wireless subcarrier and virtual machine resource scheduling algorithm is proposed to stabilize the virtual delay queues in the framework of the BP scheduling principle. Finally, the delay performance of the proposed virtual queue-based BP scheduling algorithm is evaluated via simulation experiments and compared with the traditional queue length-based BP scheduling algorithm. Results show that under the considered simulation parameters, the total delay of the proposed BP scheduling algorithm is always lower than that of the traditional queue length-based BP scheduling algorithm. The percentage of the reduced total delay can be as high as 51.29% when the computing resources are heterogeneously configured. Therefore, compared with the traditional queue length-based BP scheduling algorithms, the proposed virtual delay queue-based BP scheduling algorithm can further reduce delay in multi-cell cellular edge computing systems. © 2019, Editorial Department of Journal of Southeast University.

We examined the outcomes of HLA matching in renal transplant donors in Malaysia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 140 patients who had compatible ABO blood type with negative T-cell lymphocytotoxicity crossmatch were included in the study and 25% of them were spousal transplant donors. No remarkable differences in acute rejection rate, graft survival, patient survival and serum creatinine level were observed between the spousal and living-related donor groups. RESULTS: The spousal donor group had a higher degree of HLA mismatch than the living-related donor group. HLA-A mismatch was associated with increased rejection risk at 6 months (odds ratio [OR], 2.75; P = 0.04), 1 year (OR, 2.54; P = 0.03) and 3 years (OR, 3.69; P = 0.001). It was also observed in the deleterious effects of HLA-B and HLA-DQ loci when the number of antigen mismatches increased. The risk was 7 times higher in patients with ≥1 mismatch at HLA-A, HLA-B and HLA-DR loci than those who did not have a mismatch at these loci at 6 months (P = 0.01), 1 year (P = 0.03) and 3 years (P = 0.003). CONCLUSION: A good match for HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-DR and HLA-DQ can prevent acute rejection risk in renal transplant patients. Consequently, spousal donor transplants could be a safe intervention in renal patients."

The similarity of the feeding habitats used by the thrushes is noted. The main type of fodder habitats during the reproductive period are lawns with low vegetation cover, rarefied as a result of human influence, while they are squares and gardens with fruit bushes and trees during the autumn and winter period. The use of fodder habitats and fodder objects of anthropogenic origin is noted for the blackbird out of its period of reproduction. The differences in nutrition behavior consist in the frequency and sequence of the use of foraging acts and are associated with the thrushes’ use of various quantities of objects from the soil and from its surface. During the breeding season, sweeping motions of the beak are the most characteristic for the blackbird, and digging up objects from the soil is typical for the fieldfare. The differences in the foraging behavior of the thrushes in Kaliningrad (in contrast to natural habitats) are expressed as an increased variety of the foraging methods used and a significantly prolonged duration of examination for the blackbird and fieldfare, respectively. These differences are due to the manifestation of specific features in specific places of feeding. © 2019, Pleiades Publishing, Inc."

However, in traditional dual-frequency receivers, the relevance of dual-frequency signals are not considered, and, with no improvement imposed to the tracking loop, two independent tracking loops are used to achieve the tracking of dual-frequency signals. In this paper, the BeiDou dual-frequency signals joint tracking algorithm based on Kalman filter is proposed for the tracking of BeiDou B1I and B3I dual-frequency signals. Taking the relevance of B1I and B3I signals into consideration, the algorithm adds a Kalman filter between the phase detector and carrier loop filter of the traditional dual-frequency independent tracking loop. The output results of the phase detectors of the B1I and B3I branches are then combined and filtered by the Kalman filter, and the results are input to the carrier loop filters of the corresponding branches. Proved by experiments, the algorithm not only enables the loop to enter a stable tracking state quickly, but also reduces the noise bandwidth of the two loop filters by about 10 Hz with the same tracking performance obtained. © 2019, Editorial Department of Transactions of NUAA.

Instead of needing to carry around multiple cards for different purposes, or installing multiple separate applications, they can all be accessed by logging into the DisCard application on your chosen mobile device, which will use Near-Field Communication technology in order to emulate the physical card when swiped and scanned. How this application will work is explained, and why the author believes it is better than the currently implemented solution, being physically carrying multiple separate plastic cards with embedded chips. Afterwards, a few papers on related topics are reviewed, with said relation to the application presented, discussed. Results of exploratory surveys indicating viability in the consumer market is analysed and discussed. Positive impacts of switching to digital cards rather than physical ones are then brought to light, such as reduction of plastic waste being beneficial to the environment.

The decrease is predicted to “lead to the next significant minimum of the population size on a 100-year scale” in the 2020s (2014–2015 in Central Russia). However, the actual population size is increasing steadily for most species, including the elk, European and Siberian roe deer, red deer, sika deer, and reindeer, regardless of the “trophiclimatic” forecast. The decrease in the wild boar population is not due to climatic changes, but rather to excessive killing of the animals in view of the epizootic outbreak of African swine fever. However, the increase in the ungulate population size is unacceptably slow (less than 3% per year) and the available resources are approximately five times scarcer than the potential. The main factors that restrain population growth are unreasonably active authorized hunting, excessive poaching, and predation. The hunting policy of the government, game management, and resource management are still far from reasonable. Therefore, the ungulate population is not guaranteed against new large-scale decreases in animal numbers. © 2019, Pleiades Publishing, Inc."

Statistically significant differences between the parameters of biological activity in the top horizons (from 0- to 20-cm-thick) of the studied soils have been determined. Mountain chernozems are characterized by increased humus content (by 38%, on average), the activity of dehydrogenase (by 42%) and urease (by 35%), and the values of all microbial parameters (by 12–53%). The invertase activity is higher in plain chernozems (by 47%, on average). The dispersion analysis has shown that the effect of soil-forming conditions (mountain or plain) is a more significant factor for some of the parameters studied as compared to features of the studied soils at the subtype level. The effect of the factor of genetic differences is in the range of 1–5%, while the impact of soil-forming conditions ranges from 15 to 33%. The total biological activity of the top horizons of mountain and plain chernozems has been evaluated by an integral index of the ecological–biological soil status (IIEBSS), which shows a higher biological activity of the top horizons in mountain soils (IIEBSS varies within 5–18%). © 2019, Pleiades Publishing, Inc."

The problem of detecting compact GPOs, including the partially disguised, is reduced to a computationally simple observation-invariant procedure for detecting contrasting areal objects or a structural analysis of a graph of hierarchical grouping of the elements of the GPOs in the scene, which gives similar results. We then find the GPO detection characteristics for various observation conditions. © 2019, Pleiades Publishing, Inc."

Sendrier in 2000, if a [n,k,d]-linear code C(⊆Fn q) with length n, dimensionality k and code distance d has a trivial group of automorphisms PAut(C), it allows one to construct a determined support splitting algorithm in order to find a permutation σ for a code D, being permutation-equivalent to the code C, such that σ(C) = D. This algorithm can be used for attacking the McEliece cryptosystem based on the codeC. This work aims the construction and analysis of the support splitting algorithm for the code Fl q⊗C, induced by the code C, l ϵ N. Since the group of automorphisms PAutFl q⊗C is nontrivial even in the case of that trivial for the base code C, it enables one to assume a potentially high resistance of the McEliece cryptosystem on the code Fl q⊗C to the attack based on a carrier split. The support splitting algorithm is being constructed for the code Fl q⊗C and its efficiency is compared with the attack to a McEliece cryptosystem based on the code Fl q⊗C © 2019, Allerton Press, Inc."

Silico-alkaline liquids that are selectively extracted from xenoliths mix only to a limited extent with the basalt melt, and form granophyre bands that give lavas a taxitic texture. The unique compositions of buchites (pelitic xenoliths chemically modified with a diffusion interaction with basaltic magma and selectively molten politic xenoliths) are characterized. The mineral associations of buchites are represented by highly ferriferous cordierite (sekaninaite), ultra-ferriferous hercynite, (Al, Zr) Fe-armalcolite, Zr-ilmenite, mullite, sillimanite, high-lanthanum monazite, and a barium–phosphate–aluminosilicate phase. The features of the chemical and mineral composition of buchites reflect the accumulation of refractory elements (Al, Fe, Ti, Zr, Ni, and Cr) in the restitic material of xenoliths, followed by the formation of ultra-aluminous, ultra-ferriferous, and initially immiscible metal-silicate composition. Low Pb isotopic ratios in the Shufan basalts indicate selective contamination with material of the ancient cratonic basement. A steady increase in these values is observed for basalts contaminated with the upper crustal material, which also reflects the isotopic composition of buchites. © 2019, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd."

The increased HM content in soil causes a drop in the terminal leaflet size, in the mean number of phens (various variants of leaf shape), and in the chlorophyll b content in leaves. On the contrary, the percentage of rare phens increases. Parallel to this, the LPO rate decreases, which is not typical for plants under stress conditions. The level of chlorophyll a and carotinoids drops under moderate contamination and becomes normal at the highest one. The data obtained testify that the morphological and biochemical parameters of goutweed leaves differently characterize the status of this plant species under an increase in the level of soil contamination by HMs. Such conditions result in the impoverishment of the phenofund of A. podagraria cenopopulations and in the domination of plants with smaller leaves. Nevertheless, their LPO rate and the content of some pigments may remain close to normal. The results of our study show that A. podagraria is a species that is able to maintain biochemical homeostasis under the conditions of soil contamination by heavy metals. Thus, contrary to the biochemical parameters studied, the morphological features more accurately characterize the adverse changes in cenopopulations of goutweed, which is important for the bioindication of ecosystems under anthropogenic contamination. © 2019, Pleiades Publishing, Inc."

Formal changes can be captured in a cross linguistically valid way by adopting Keizer’s grammaticalization scale rather than traditional ones. Finally, congestive and formal scales can be linked in a typologically adequate way by assuming a relative rather than absolute relationship between them. © 2019, Hampstead Psychological Associates.

The low frequency trend component of the typhoon speed was also discussed. The field measurement results show turbulence intensity has strong dependence to the wind speed, upwind terrain and even the relative location to the Typhoon center. The low frequency fluctuation could severely affect the characteristics of wind. Cross correlation of the measured wind speeds on different buildings also showed some dependence on the upwind terrain roughness.

In the modern model of the cavitation effect, the destruction of materials is associated with the impacts of cumulative jets, which are formed during the asymmetric slamming of cavitation bubbles near the solid surface, and the shock waves that occur during their compression. In the new model, erosion damage is explained by the formation of cavitation tubes (с-tubes) with a spiral high-frequency structure in the materials under consideration, and these tubes were previously unknown in the literature. The destruction of materials is associated with the focusing of acoustic energy along the axis of the spiral structures. When the energy is focused, there is a significant increase in the pressure and temperature along the axis of the spiral structures, which leads to the destruction of the materials under study. © 2019, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd."

The basis of the study is an automatically generated thesaurus of a domain, that contains three types of relations: synonymous, hierarchical and associative. To generate the thesaurus the authors use a hybrid method based on several linguistic and statistical algorithms for extraction of semantic relations. The method allows to create a thesaurus with a sufficiently large number of terms and relations among them. The authors consider two problems: topical text classification and sentiment classification of large newspaper articles. To solve them, the authors developed two approaches that complement standard algorithms with a procedure that take into account thesaurus relations to determine semantic features of texts. The approach to topical classification includes the standard unsupervised BM25 algorithm and the procedure, that take into account synonymous and hierarchical relations of the thesaurus of the domain. The approach to sentiment classification consists of two steps. At the first step, a thesaurus is created, whose terms weight polarities are calculated depending on the term occurrences in the training set or on the weights of related thesaurus terms. At the second step, the thesaurus is used to compute the features of words from texts and to classify texts by the algorithm SVM or Naive Bayes. In experiments with text corpora BBCSport, Reuters, PubMed and the corpus of articles about American immigrants, the authors varied the types of thesaurus relations that are involved in the classification and the degree of their use. The results of the experiments make it possible to evaluate the efficiency of the application of thesaurus relations for classification of raw texts and to determine under what conditions certain relations affect more or less. In particular, the most useful thesaurus relations are synonymous and hierarchical, as they provide a better quality of classification. © 2019, Allerton Press, Inc."

It is possible for time-delay systems to generate multiple positive Lyapunov exponents without the limitation of system dimension. Firstly, the homoclinic orbit analysis is carried out by using the bifurcation theory, and it is found that there are two homoclinic orbits in the system. According to the corresponding relationship, solitary waves also exist in the system. Secondly, the Melnikov method is used to prove that homoclinic orbits can evolve into chaos under arbitrary perturbations, and then chaotic signals are used as the carriers of information transmission. The Lyapunov exponent spectrum, phase diagram and time series of the system also prove the existence of chaos. Thirdly, an exponential synchronization controller is designed to achieve the chaotic synchronization between the driving system and the response system, and it is proved by the Lyapunov stability theory. Finally, the error system is simulated by using MATLAB, and it is found that the error tends to zero in a very short time. Numerical simulation results demonstrate that the proposed exponential synchronization scheme can effectively guarantee the chaotic synchronization within 1 s. © 2019, Editorial Department of Journal of Southeast University.

For the atmospheric boundary layer case, the inflow turbulence is generated by a numerical wind tunnel. In the numerical simulation, particular attention is devoted to the performance of an auto hexahedral non-structural mesh. Both simulations are performed for three grid systems: an auto hexahedral non-structured grid, a structured Cartesian grid and a non-structured triangular prism grid, and for three grid numbers. The present study shows that the auto hexahedral unstructured mesh achieves the best simulation results for wind pressures on the square cylinder and the high-rise building. When the grid number is sufficiently large, the differences among the results obtained from the three investigated grid systems are not significant. However, the advantage of the auto hexahedral unstructured mesh becomes clear when the grid number decreases, because it enables a balanced distribution of orthogonal grids. The results described in this paper demonstrate that the auto hexahedral non-structured mesh has good potential applicability to simulation of urban flows. © 2019 Korea Distribution Science Association."

The idea of word2vec is based on a simple rule that a higher similarity can be reached if two words have a similar context. Each word can be represented as a vector, so the closest coordinates of vectors can be interpreted as similar words. It allows to establish semantic relations (synonymy, relations of hypernymy and hyponymy and other semantic relations) by applying an automatic extraction. The extraction of semantic relations by hand is considered as a time-consuming and biased task, requiring a large amount of time and some help of experts. Unfortunately, the word2vec model provides an associative list of words which does not consist of relative words only. In this paper, we show some additional criteria that may be applicable to solve this problem. Observations and experiments with well-known characteristics, such as word frequency, a position in an associative list, might be useful for improving results for the extraction of semantic relations for the Russian language by using word embedding. In the experiments, the word2vec model trained on the Flibusta and pairs from Wiktionary are used as examples with semantic relationships.

In order to preserve the hollow organs of different animals, an air-drying pump (compressor) was used; then, the preserved specimens were expanded through the injection of foam into their lumen followed by the application of varnish on their external surface to protect them from insect damage. This method of preservation is suitable for developing countries because it is cheap to prepare, simple to perform, and can be performed at room temperature (37°-40°C) without special equipment. The produced specimens have many advantages: their normal anatomical form remains durable, very light in weight, non- toxic regarding handling, and resistant to improper handling and deterioration by fungi or bacteria, with all structures very clear. These preserved specimens last for many years without any changes. © 2018 Oxford University Press. All rights reserved."

The present study investigates the dermatoglyphic patterns among adolescents of the Ebira ethnic group through selected dialects. A total of 591 subjects, both males and females, participated in the study. Prints were collected by conventional ink and roller method and read using hand magnifying lens. Analyses were performed using descriptive statistics, analysis of variance (ANOVA), t -test, and the chi-squared test. P-values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. The result of the study showed that the three dialects had similar distribution of fingerprint patterns in the order ulnar loop > whorl > arch > radial loop. The fingerprint pattern showed strong statistical association with gender both within and across the dialects (p < 0.001). The palmar crease of the subjects showed the normal palmar crease to be the most prevalent (87%), followed by the Sidney crease (9%), and the Suwon crease (4%) being the least prevalent for both palms across the dialects. There was strong association with palm crease type and gender, with p < 0.001. The triradii angles of the palms revealed a mean value of acute angles. Females had significantly higher mean atd angles compared with male subjects, while males had significant higher mean dat angles compared with females for the three dialects. The adt angle, however, showed no significant mean difference between males and females. In conclusion, the present study evaluated the fingerprint patterns, the palmar creases and the triradii angles conforming anthropological similarities within these three dialects.

The contradiction between data presentation in the real subject domain and the model of data presentation in the relational and NoSQL approaches is revealed. The revealed contradiction is related to the temporality of the values of individual data attributes, the variability of the composition of these attributes, and structure of connections between them. A new logical model of the data warehouse with dynamic structure is proposed. The model is based on the concept of the object as a container for properties storage. Each property of the object includes the property name and two property values—without reference and with reference, that are relevant at a given time. The reference property value points to an object whose name is interpreted as the value of the property at a given time. A formal description of the model with allocation of the necessary functionality to manipulate objects and their properties (selectors, predicates, constructors) is given and the necessary control structures are introduced. Substantiation of the proposed model, called an OP-model is given on the basis of compliance with the logical ER data model. It is proved that any ER data model can be implemented in the OP-model. At the same time, the advantages of the OP-model are indicated, they are associated with the possibility of changing connections between entities due to changes in the reference value at a particular time. The potential for scalability of data warehouse due to the unique identification of each object is noted. © 2019, Allerton Press, Inc."

The performance of a classification model can be varied depending on what type of words contained in the document corpus and what type of features generated for classification. Aside from proposing a new modified version of the existing algorithm or creating a new algorithm, we attempt to modify the use of data. The classifier performance is usually affected by the quality of learning data as the classifier is built based on these training data. We assume that the data from different domains might have different characteristics of noise, which can be utilized in the process of learning the classifier. Therefore, we attempt to enhance the robustness of the classifier by injecting the heterogeneous data artificially into the learning process in order to improve the classification accuracy. Semi-supervised approach was applied for utilizing the heterogeneous data in the process of learning the document classifier. However, the performance of document classifier might be degraded by the unlabeled data. Therefore, we further proposed an algorithm to extract only the documents that contribute to the accuracy improvement of the classifier. © 2019 Korean Society of Management Information Systems."

In this study, Cu/Mg-composites with 1, 7 and 49 magnesium filaments in Cu-matrix have been obtained by hyrdoextrusion at room temperature. The structure, mechanical and electrical properties of the composite rods and thin wires in the deformed and annealed states have been investigated. The strength of the deformed Cu/Mg-composite with a minimal volume fraction of magnesium was found to be abnormally high. The increase of magnesium microhardness was revealed to be near the interface. A change in the lattice constant of the Cu-matrix in the deformed Cu/Mg-composites is discovered by the XRD-method. It has been concluded that, under severe plastic deformation, different solid solutions form on the Cu/Mg-interfaces due to mechanical alloying processes. The Cu/Mg-composite with a maximal volume fraction of Mg has the lowest strength in the deformed state, however, it becomes the strongest one after annealing at 200°C due to annealing hardening of magnesium. The temperature dependences of the electrical resistivity of Cu/Mg-composites differ significantly from each other. During heating, three eutectic transformations are realized in the composite with 7 Mg-filaments. As a result, the electrical resistivity of the deformed Cu/7Mg-composite increases almost two times. The specific electrical resistivity of the composite with 49 Mg-filaments is a bit different from the electrical resistivity of deformed copper. The mechanisms of structure formation during the heating of these composites have been shown to be significantly different. The obtained results can be used for the development of high-strength Cu-based conductors. © 2019, Institute for Metals Superplasticity Problems of Russian Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved."

Therefore, the current tasks at hand are the verification of already created development programs and the development of “proper” programs for the development of such systems, by analogy with the verification and development of proper computer programs through advanced disciplines in theoretical programming. In this paper, in order to solve the problem of the verification of development programs for agricultural territories, a structural scheme of the program is first constructed, through which an axiomatic theory is created using the Hoare’s algorithmic logic system. The main problem in the construction of the axiomatic theory is the development of the axioms of the theory that reflect preconditions and effects of the implementation of meaningful actions indicated in the text of the development program. The verification of the development program corresponds to the provability check of some Hoare triplet, according to the initial and target conditions of the program. For the task of elaborating proper development programs, we describe the mechanism for constructing a domain model using the PDDL family description languages. The description of a specific model is purely declarative in nature and consists of descriptions of predicates and actions of the chosen subject area. In this paper, using the described model with the help of intelligent planners, including temporal planners such as OPTIC, we show how to automatically build solutions to the targets of development programs. Based on expert knowledge and industry standards, a model of an agricultural territory is constructed, a brief description of which is given in this work. The conducted experiments showed the effectiveness of the proposed approach for the development of proper development programs. © 2019, Allerton Press, Inc."

Since π-calculus is a Turing-complete computation model, this problem is unsolvable in the general case. Therefore, its study is carried out only for some special classes of π-calculus processes with restricted computational capabilities, for example, for nonrecursive processes with all runs limited in length, for processes with a limited number of parallel components, etc. However, even in these cases the proposed checking procedures are very time consuming. We assume that this is due to the very nature of the π-calculus processes.

Sequential analysis involves identifying tourist potential and its developmental stages, with reference to natural and human elements. Herculane is one of the oldest spa towns of the world, dating from antiquity. Since its discovery (102 b. Cr.) up to now, the area has been subject to a special developmental process. In the early stage, the Romans built aqueducts, baths, monuments dedicated to Hercules, all of them being of interest to tourists near Rome. The waters discovered in the area had a powerful healing effect and so Herculane became one the most important spas in Europe (Olaru M. (1996). The Banat Mountains–natural and antrophic potential, Hestia Publishing House, Timişoara). The peak stage occurs much later, after 1700, with the beginning of the Austrian imperial rule, when there was a higher interest in reconstructing and modernizing. Most of the access ways and buildings were rebuilt. In 1736, the governor of Banat, recognizes the Hercules’ spring as the most important one. Although the local upgrades attracted tourists since ancient times, after 1990, Herculane enters a sharp decline. This stage reflects the decay of the thermal baths: the treatment and accommodation facilities deteriorate, the access ways are poor, and the authorities’ interest decreases. The serious lack of investment produces repulsion to the tourists who used to make treatment in the well-known resort. The resort is transforming from an exceptional spa centre, where tourists used to come every year to treat rheumatism, breathing or circulation diseases, in a poor space in terms of infrastructure, accommodation and medical services. If other country resorts follow an ascending path, the spa belonging to the Domogled – Cerna Valley National Park had a unique evolution. Today, the authorities have to elaborate well-defined strategies in order to revive this resort. © 2019, ASERS Publishing House. All rights reserved."

In this study, bentonite was mixed with alkaline solution in a closed system and reacted for 3-24 months. Furthermore, swelling tests were conducted on the alkaline-dissolved bentonite immersed in distilled water. The swelling deformation decreased significantly with increases in the concentration of NaOH solution and reaction time, and this was mainly due to montmorillonite dissolution. The fractal e-p relationship (e is the void ratio and p is the vertical pressure) with two calculation coefficients (the swelling coefficient and the fractal dimension) was employed to determine the swelling of alkaline-dissolved bentonite. The fractal dimension increased slightly with increasing reaction time or concentration of NaOH solution, as the dissolution traces caused by the alkaline solution favoured an increase in the irregularity and fractality of the bentonite surface. The swelling coefficient decreased linearly with decreasing montmorillonite content. In addition, the swelling coefficient and the fractal dimension were related exponentially to the reaction time in alkaline solution. A relationship between the swelling of alkaline-dissolved samples and the reaction time was proposed, which might be used to assess the swelling properties of bentonite barriers that would be affected by long-term dissolution of the alkaline solution in a closed repository.

Results show that the UFB concentration increased with increasing generation time and the O2-UFB size distribution was shifted to smaller sizes after longer generation times. In addition, the results suggested that O2-UFBs need time to stabilize and achieve smaller sizes. UFBs remained in the water after storage for 7 days, but the water became contaminated by bacteria. Furthermore, a hydrophilic filter is recommended for medical applications because it blocks the particles but allows the passage of fine bubbles. It was found that the choice of the hydrophilic filter material affects the O2-UFB transport rate and concentration. © 2019, Institute of Electrostatics. All rights reserved."

As for the VJ algorithm, an improved version for Matlab is used, which is able to detect the parts of the face even when it has an inclination of up to 20°. The tests are carried out with 10 images of the CelebA dataset, in such a way that each algorithm identifies the complete face, the right and left eye independently, and finally the mouth. In the event that any part of the face has been removed, the algorithm should not detect that section, since if it does it is counted as a false positive.

The absolute impedance value is determined by measurement of voltages in the cell and over the known resistance connected in series with it. The impedance dispersion range is found in the range of 104–106 Hz, where it decreases from the maximum to the minimum values. The processing of the impedance data using the corresponding equivalent circuit shows that distilled water has a constant dielectric permeability value (78–80 a.u.) in the whole studied range of 50 Hz to 10 MHz and impedance dispersion is related to dispersion of conductivity of water. An expression is obtained for description of conductivity of water at low, intermediate, and high frequencies (0–100 MHz) analogous to the Debye relationship.

The goal of the present study is to assess the prevalence of pancreatic duct patterns in the Indian population, both by cadaveric dissection and by magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP). Materials and Methods A total of 15 adult pancreas specimens of unknown age and gender, and 5 fetal pancreas specimens of different gestational ages with the intact second part of duodenum, were dissected by the piecemeal method. For clinical relevance, MRCP images of 103 clinically-diagnosed chronic pancreatitis patients irrespective of their etiology were obtained retrospectively from the existing database and studied. The anatomical patterns were classified as five different types based on the course of the main pancreatic duct and the accessory pancreatic duct and their openings into the duodenal wall, including variants like pancreas divisum and ansa pancreatica. Results In the cadaveric study, the main pancreatic duct was single with a straight course in 46.67% of the adult specimens, and in the MRCP study, the main pancreatic duct showed a descending course in 77.66% of the cases. The most common pattern was type III in both the cadaveric (80%) and radiological (55.33%) studies, and the accessory duct was absent on the MRCP in all type-III cases, while it ended blindly in the cadaveric specimens. Ansa pancreatica (type V) was observed in 1 adult specimen (6.7%), but not in the radiological study. Pancreas divisum (type IV) was observed in the 8 cases (7.76%) cases in the radiological study.

The soft tissue variations of cleft hand are rarely described. Hence, we report the anatomic variants of a unilateral atypical cleft hand with the absence of all of the phalanges of the middle finger. The 2 nd and 3 rd lumbricals showed a variation in their distal attachment. Both the superficial and deep flexor digital tendons of the missing middle finger were fused and inserted into the palmar surface of the head of the 3 rd metacarpal bone. The extensor digitorum tendon of the missing finger was inserted on the dorsal surface of the head of the 3 rd metacarpal bone. The palmar digital nerves of the median nerve of the middle finger formed 2 visible fibrotic masses; radial and ulnar, over the base of the 2 nd web space. Of these, the radial mass was formed by the fusion of both palmar digital nerves and the common palmar digital artery. The knowledge of soft tissue abnormalities reported here is clinically important to plastic surgeons while restoring the good grasp and pinch of the cleft hand. The occurrence of fibrotic masses reported in the present case is unique, and these masses may cause diagnostic errors during an angiographic procedure. © 2020 Georg Thieme Verlag.

Considering the threat that C. stoebe poses to prairie ecosystems, we examined the effectiveness of fire as a control for C. stoebe and (±)-catechin, a known allelopathic compound. We conducted an experiment in a reconstructed tallgrass prairie community at Pierce Cedar Creek Institute in Barry County, Michigan starting in May 2016. Our experiment consisted of individually burning 60 1-m2 plots with a propane torch to achieve high (316°C) and low (103°C) temperatures across spring and summer seasons over two years, then planting and seeding six native prairie plant species to monitor their establishment after burning. We compared the effects of the different burn treatments on the plant community by estimating percent cover and biomass of all species within each plot in August 2017. We also examined the effects of the simulated burn treatments on soil (±)-catechin levels, which we quantified using High Performance Liquid Chromatography. Centaurea stoebe was less dominant in burned plots than unburned plots, with summer-burned plots having the lowest biomass and cover. Differences in burn temperature failed to produce significantly different results. Planted native grasses increased more after spring burns than after summer burns. Preliminary findings suggest that high-temperature spring burns may indirectly reduce soil (±)-catechin levels. Overall, these results indicate that prescribed burning is an effective tool for controlling C. stoebe and promoting native species establishment in restored tallgrass prairies. ©2019 by the Board of Regents of the University of Wisconsin System."

The optical measurement and cyclone separation methods are separately used to investigate the evaporation rate of a jet into cross-flow. Experimental results show that the fuel evaporation rate in cross-flow is mainly affected by the Weber number (We), equivalent ratio (φ), momentum rate of fuel to air (q), and air temperature.

Various types of serial sections of ovaries and cephalic regions were obtained. Four histological staining techniques were employed. In controlled preparations, the neurosecretory activities of A-cells and C-cells showed correlation with cellular activities of oogonia, oocytes and trophocytes. In experimental preparations, removal of A-cells caused abnormalities in oocytes and trophocytes. The regeneration of A-cells restored vitellogenesis and repaired abnormalities. In both preparations, C-cells remained aldehyde-fuchsin (AF)-positive. B-cells and U-cells remained AF-negative. The oogonia showed continuous mitotic divisions. Regenerated A-cells appeared in week 3, increased in number, but could not stop the abnormalities, as hormones were not transported due to the lack or scarcity of blood capillaries. Therefore, abnormalities increased extremely. Then, they stopped, decreased, and were repaired due to hormonal transport via fully reconstructed blood capillary plexuses. The main conclusions are: (1) oocytes and trophocytes are controlled by A-cells, since they exhibited prominent changes during the removal and regeneration of A-cells; (2) oogonia are controlled by C-cells, as they showed correlation of activities with C-cells and were not affected by the removal and regeneration of A-cells; (3) B-cells and U-cells remained inactive; hence, they have no role in oogonia divisions and vitellogenesis; and (4) delayed hormonal effects of regenerated A-cells were due to the lack or scarcity of blood capillaries. Therefore, fully reconstructed blood capillary beds in the A-cells area are indispensable for hormonal diffusion, transport and effectivity. © 2020 Georg Thieme Verlag. All rights reserved."

An assessment was made, and the coincidence of the total atomic hydrogen content in the exosphere with the number of protons (after thermolization converted into hydrogen ions) precipitated in the SAA zone over a year according to the data of the Meteor M and NOAA-19 satellites was confirmed. The observed coincidence indicates that the rates of replenishment of hydrogen due to precipitation from radiation belts and dissipation into outer space coincide in the order of magnitude. It is concluded that the exosphere hydrogen is mainly of cosmic origin and its main source is the thermalized protons of galactic cosmic rays, solar cosmic rays, and in part, the solar wind. © 2019, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd."

We consider the class of equations that represent a perturbation of a linear autonomous equation, in general, with an unbounded operator. The perturbation takes the form of a family of bounded operators that, in a sense, oscillatorally decreases at infinity. It is assumed that the unperturbed equation satisfies the standard requirements of the center manifold theory. The essence of the proposed asymptotic integration method is to prove the existence of a center-like manifold (a critical manifold) for the initial equation. This manifold is positively invariant with respect to the initial equation and attracts all trajectories of the weak solutions. The dynamics of the initial equation on the critical manifold is described by the finite-dimensional system of ordinary differential equations. The asymptotics of the fundamental matrix of this system can be constructed by using the method developed by P.N. Nesterov for asymptotic integration of systems with oscillatory decreasing coefficients. We illustrate the proposed technique by constructing the asymptotic representations for solutions of the perturbed heat equation. © 2019, Allerton Press, Inc."

For a bialgebra H, if it is unital and associative as an algebra and counital coassociative as a coalgebra, then the Galois linear maps T1 and T2 can be defined. For such a bialgebra H, it is a Hopf algebra if and only if T1 is bijective. Moreover, T1 -1 is a right H-module map and a left H-comodule map (similar to T2). On the other hand, for a unital algebra ( no need to be associative), and a counital coassociative coalgebra A, if the coproduct and counit are both algebra morphisms, then the sufficient and necessary condition of A to be a Hopf quasigroup is that T1 is bijective, and T1 -1 is left compatible with ΔT-11 r and right compatible with mT-11 l at the same time (The properties are similar to T2).

This paper presents a method of reducing the radical alteration in WTE versus distance, by using a reverse loop technique on planar reverse loop antenna (PRLA). The design focuses on 13.56 MHz Near Field Communication (NFC). The first stage uses mathematical modelling, based on an analytical approach, to determine the size of the reverse loop using Matlab. The proposed model predicts the size of the reverse loop to stabilize the WTE at a closer distance. Next, full-wave electromagnetic simulations are applied, using the computer simulation technology (CST) MICROWAVE STUDIO®, to determine the WTE effect with distance changes with mismatch condition. Planar loop antennas (PLAs) are fabricated on glass-reinforced epoxy laminated sheets (FR4). A validation of the simulation result in a real test scenario, using these PLAs and PRLA, confirms a stability enhancement in WTE at closer distance using the reverse loop technique, compared to conventional designs.

We assume that lengths of intervals θk between the moments of impulses τk are random variables and the sizes of impulse influence depend on random parameters vk, k = 1, 2,… One example of such objects is an impulsive equation that simulates dynamics of the population subject to harvesting. In the absence of harvesting, the population development is described by the differential equation x = g(x), and in time points τk some random share of resource vk, k = 1, 2,… is taken from the population. We can control the gathering process so that to stop harvesting when its share will appear big enough to save the biggest possible remaining resource to increase the size of the next gathering. Let the equation x=g(x) have an asymptotic stable solution ϕ(t) ≡ K whose attraction region is the interval (K1,K2) where 0 ≤ K1 < K < K2 We construct the control u = (u1,…, uk,…), which limits a share of the harvested resource at each moment of time τk so that the quantity of the remaining resource, since some moment τk0 would be not less than the given value x ϵ (K1,K). For any x ϵ (K1,K) the estimates of the average temporal benefit, valid with the probability of one, are obtained. It is shown that there is a unique x* ϵ (K1,K), at which the lower estimate reaches the greatest value. Thus, we described the way of population control at which the value of the average time profit can be lower estimated with the probability of one by the greatest number whenever possible. © 2019, Allerton Press, Inc."

It was found that, in the case of fracture of bolts in the package connecting the frame elements, the damage of the bolts is the result of the fretting corrosion due to the mutual friction between bolts and elements of skin, belt, and tape. Fretting corrosion develops in the locations of the cadmium coating damage of bolts in the process of friction. The break-in scuffing of the openings and corrosive damage (fretting corrosion) triggering intergranular fracture, which is the most severe in the skin and tape, contribute to the fractures in the belt, skin, and tape. The reason for fracture is structural and technological factors: high stresses in the investigated package, micro-displacement of the mating parts, violation of the cadmium coating, insufficient protection against corrosion and environmental impact. Fracture of the self-locking nuts made of 30KhGSA steel with the anticorrosion cadmium coating used during assembly of an auxiliary gas turbine engine is induced by their severe overheating—the impact of the melted coating on the surface of the loaded nuts and penetration of the liquid metal into the base material along the grain boundaries. Application of the cadmium coating for the operation of the steel parts at a temperature exceeding (even for a short time) the melting temperature of Cd (Tmelt = 320.9°C) under the condition of contact with the stressed metal owing to the Rebinder effect leads to a dramatic loss of strength and premature failure of the part. Fracture of the galvanized bolts made of 30KhGSA steel was studied in the process of the repeated static testing. It was found that several factors contributed to the onset of the multiple fractures: rough scratch marks, sandblasting performed before galvanizing with the use of large sand fractions, dents which contribute to the premature origin of cracks, areas with deposits formed during coating with loose adhesion of the layer. The presence of a large number of pits along with the fatigue grooves indicates the operation of the material under high load.

A design of a mobile unit in which by means of reversal it is possible to change the load direction and to test the reinforced element of the established form under both tension and compression is presented. This reduces the nomenclature of test equipment and the number of forms for the manufacture of concrete samples. The values ​​of intrinsic stresses and the magnitude of deformations due to concrete shrinkage are determined by the forces of the crack formation in concrete when the joint operation of concrete and reinforcement is broken. An analytical dependence of the forces and deformations of a reinforced concrete sample with central reinforcement upon axial tension and compression taking into account deformations and stresses in the reinforcement and concrete on the concrete shrinkage is established. The results of experimental studies including concrete tensile diagrams and diagrams of the development of axial deformations with increasing load under central loading of reinforced elements are presented.

Many parents, desperate after the Kristallnacht, sent their children abroad alone. About 1,800 arrived in the Netherlands. While for some the Netherlands was an intermediate stop, many stayed. We use a mixed-method approach with the aim of providing a better understanding of the survival rates of refugee children using information from several sources. The qualitative research provides illustrative individual experiences of child refugees and facilitates the formulation of hypotheses of settlement trajectories on risks of deportation and being killed, which are then tested using a quantitative approach. Gathering information into a database allows us to estimate the risk associated the living situation and place in the Netherlands. Among 863 Kindertransport children staying in the Netherlands in July 1942, 74 percent were deported and of those deported 81 percent were killed. Differences in settlement trajectories resulted in different risks of deportation and death. Children living with family or relatives had a higher risk of being deported than those living with foster parents or in institutions. Children living with foster parents had a similar risk of deportation to those living in institutions. Changing household type did not alter risk of deportation, while moving places increased this risk. Children deported from foster parents' households had an increased risk of death after deportation compared to those deported from institutions, indicating an enduring effect of household type. © 2019 Social Science History Association."

The focus of this research was to figure out the pore size distribution, particularly in correlation with permeability, from MICP measurements. In this project, the rock samples were taken from Sarawak Basin in Malaysia, in the form of chips. In general, MICP profiling is very dependent on simple size due to both conformance and accessibility of pores. Due to conformance, a correction approach was applied in which we considered the samples' pore volume compression before it was intruded into samples. Mercury injection is used to help in determining the numerous properties of tight shale storage, because there are instances where cuttings from a drilled formation may be limited, and the source rock needed may not be available to be evaluated unless a whole core is taken. Core profiles and cuttings may seem like more plausible choices in calibrating well logs. The distribution of pores and their identification in a single sample may provide the required information on the permeability, porosity and bulk volume of the formation. It could be seen in the results that MICP is highly applicable to capture and figure out the pores size distribution and density in a shale and sandstone sample. From that point of view, the transportation of the gas from the source rock, through the fractures flow paths, into production wells could be understood. Therefore, MICP is a recommended method in analyzing the formation's permeability via its pore size distribution. However, the objective of this study could not be fully envisaged as it has been observed that there are several limitations when it comes to studying shale gas, and these limitations are not only from the unavailability of equipment but also the problem about the number of samples available. © 2006-2019 Asian Research Publishing Network (ARPN)."

Aiming at the particularity of the oblique IMU, a two-position null adjustment algorithm is proposed. By this algorithm, the nulls of the oblique installed IMU can be estimated only by selecting two positions from 24 positions that IMU can be put on. This algorithm takes into account the installation errors between the gyroscope/accelerometer and the IMU and therefore has higher theoretical precision. The verification experiment results indicate that the precision of the ""two-position"" algorithm is equivalent to that of the ""24-position"" algorithm. This algorithm is more convenient to adjust the nulls and has been applied in engineering field. © 2019, Editorial Department of Journal of Chinese Inertial Technology. All right reserved."

At low stresses, before 30% of the maximum tensile stress, mixtures showed acoustoelastic response, with linear UPV variation as the stress increased. Beyond 30% of the maximum load UPVs started to decay, indicating the degradation of the material due to the onset and propagation of microcracks. Close to failure, mixtures presented an even steeper UPV decay, indicating the degradation of the elastic properties. Measured third-order elastic constants indicate a high acoustoelastic sensitivity of concrete under tensile stresses. The different magnitudes of the third-order parameters of the mixtures demonstrate the potential of acoustoelasticity in ultrasonic investigation of concrete. Results also proved that mechanical damage due to tensile stresses, beyond the acoustoelastic region, induce a decrease in both Lame constants. © 2019, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd."

Repeat testing, frequent emergency department (ED) visits, and increases in other cardiac-related procedures can be a burden on patients and payers and can complicate treatment planning. We assessed downstream healthcare resource utilization (HCRU) for patients undergoing initial single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI), stress echocardiography (ECHO), or exercise treadmill testing (ETT) with probable type I myocardial infarction (MI). Methods: Electronic medical records data from 12,130 patients with probable type I MI presenting to EDs within a large healthcare system comprised of 11 adult hospitals were retrospectively analyzed. Logistic and linear regression determined the individual contribution of SPECT-MPI, ETT, and ECHO on repeat cardiovascular (CV) testing, inpatient visits, outpatient visits, and cardiac-related costs within 12 months of the index visit. Results: The majority of patients received SPECT-MPI for the index-testing event (56.5%), followed by ETT (29.2%) and ECHO (14.3%). Patients who had SPECT-MPI at the index visit were less likely to have a repeat CV testing visit (odds ratio [OR] 0.77, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.62‒0.96; p = 0.020) or an inpatient visit (OR 0.70, 95% CI 0.49‒0.98; p = 0.039) than those who underwent ETT or ECHO. ETT and ECHO were not predictive of any outcome. Conclusions: SPECT-MPI does not result in more downstream HCRU than ETT or ECHO and is associated with a lower likelihood of repeat non-invasive CV testing and inpatient visits. © 2019, The Author(s)."

The CO2 dense gas had been captured and transported through pipeline to store in tanks. Accidents of continuous release of dense gas form the pipeline or storage tank will make a harmful and strong impact on the atmospheric environment. The dispersion of such hazardous gas constitutes a severe human health threat for inhabitants adjacent to the industries and storage areas. In the present study, wind tunnel experiments were performed to determine the dispersion characteristics of CO2 dense gas continuously spilling from two identical sources with side-by-side in a turbulent boundary layer. Effects of different gaps between two sources and various source discharge strengths on the heavy gas plumes dispersion were conducted in the experiments. Experimental results reveal that two dense plumes do not merge at the near field as the gap of two sources is greater than 30 times of discharged source diameter for the cases of different discharging strength with the densimetric Froude number 20, 22, and 26. The maximum value of vertical concentration profile at each of the downstream station increases with increasing the densimetric Froude number of discharge. The dispersion length scale of merged dense plume increases along with the downstream distance. © 2019, Chinese Institute of Civil and Hydraulic Engineering. All right reserved."

The incrementality means that we start with the most straightforward specification of the simplest algorithm in real numbers and finish with a realistic specification and a verification of the algorithm in computer arithmetic. We call our approach combined because we start with consideration of a “basic” case, the manual (pen-and-paper) verification of the algorithm in real numbers, then use this verification as proof-outlines for the manual verification of the algorithm in computer arithmetic, and finish with a computer-aided validation of the manual proofs with a proof-assistant system to avoid appeals to “obviousness” that are common in human-carried proofs. In the paper, we apply our platform-independent incremental combined approach to specification and verification of the standard mathematical square root function. By now, the computer-aided validation of the developed algorithms has been carried out only partially to prove, using the ACL2 system, the correctness (consistency) of our fixed-point arithmetic and the existence of a look-up table with the initial approximations of the square roots for fixed-point numbers. © 2019, Allerton Press, Inc."

This study explores intervention delivery and perceptions of content when an intervention is embedded within an organization's usual practice and associations with weight outcomes. Methods: This is a secondary analysis from the Healthy Eating and Active Living Taught at Home (HEALTH) randomized trial. HEALTH is a weight gain prevention intervention embedded within a national home visiting programme (Parents as Teachers, PAT). To be consistent with PAT practice, HEALTH has a suggested but also flexible home visit structure. Therefore, the number and frequency of home visits are determined by the family's needs and preferences based on the parent educator's professional judgement. The proportion of participants who received each curriculum core lesson was explored among the 105 families randomized to the HEALTH intervention group, as were mean parent educator perception ratings of the visits (5-point Likert-type scale). A chi-square test was used to examine the association between utilization (ie, low: 1-6, middle: 7-12, or high: 13-18 visits) category and weight maintenance. Results: Mothers received on average 13.3 (standard deviation 6.2) core visits. Mean parent educator perception of the mothers' response (out of 5) ranged from 3.99 to 4.27; educators' perception of their own experience with the lesson ranged from 4.13 to 4.34. Among mothers who maintained their weight, 13% were low, 22% were middle, and 65% were high utilizers, while among mothers who gained weight, 3%, 31%, and 67% were low, middle, and high utilizers, respectively; this difference was not statistically significant. Conclusions: This study identified wide variation in the visits families received from the curriculum but minimal variation in visit perceptions. Future studies could explore whether there are optimal patterns for visit content, associated with successful outcomes. © 2019 The Authors.

This bacterium plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of different diseases of the digestive system, such as chronic gastritis, peptic ulcer, and gastric adenocarcinoma. Accurate diagnosis of H. pylori infection is very important in the effective management of many gastroduodenal diseases. There is no gold typical technique that is been well-known for the detection of H. pylori infection. A multiplex polymerase chain reaction (mPCR) for glmM and 16S rRNA genes was established in our study for sensitive detection of H. pylori from gastric biopsies. Different classical detection techniques have been used lately with mPCR like Rapid Urease Test (RUT), histology and antibody (Serology) test. Detection of housekeeping (HK) genes by monoplex and multiplex PCR with different sets of primers for 16S rRNA due to heterogenicity and high variability in this gene. Our results show that a total of 123 (58.5 %) from 210 patients were positive for H. pylori infection. H. pylori were detected in 46.6% (98/210) by RUT, 54.7% (115/210) by histology, 85.7% (180/210 false-positive results were included) by H. pylori IgG, and 57.1% (120/210) through mPCR. By this molecular technique, H. pylori were detected in 100% of biopsies with positive histology and RUT.

We re-analyse the RV data for this system and focus on the possibility of a second, super-Earth mass, planet. We compute the time-scale for fast resonant librations in the eccentricity to be ∼ 2000 d. Given that the observations were taken over 700 d, we expect to see the effect of these librations in the observations. We perform a fully dynamical fit to test this hypothesis. Similar to previous results, we determine that the data could be fit by two planets in a 2:1 mean motion resonance. However, we also find solutions near the 5:4 mean motion resonance that are not present when planet-planet interactions are ignored. Using the mean exponential growth of nearby orbits indicator, we analyse the stability of the system and find that our solutions lie in a stable region of parameter space. We also find that though out-of-resonance solutions are possible, the system favours a configuration that is in a first-order mean motion resonance. The existence of mean motion resonances has important implications in many planet formation theories. Although we do not attempt to distinguish between the one- and two-planet models in this work, in either case, the predicted orbital parameters are interesting enough to merit further study.

Eye tracking systems in contemporary vision research and applications face major challenges due to variable operating conditions such as user distance, head pose, and movements of the eye tracker platform. However, there is a lack of open-source tools and datasets that could be used for quantitatively evaluating an eye tracker’s data quality, comparing performance of multiple trackers, or studying the impact of various operating conditions on a tracker’s accuracy. To address these issues, an open-source code repository named GazeVisual-Lib is developed that contains a number of algorithms, visualizations, and software tools for detailed and quantitative analysis of an eye tracker’s performance and data quality. In addition, a new labelled eye gaze dataset that is collected from multiple user platforms and operating conditions is presented in an open data repository for benchmark comparison of gaze data from different eye tracking systems.

"Temporal changes in China's air temperature distribution and its impact on hot extreme occurrence","2019","Atmosphere","0","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85079826953&doi=10.3390%2fATMOS10120748&partnerID=40&md5=465d173b652915b6f1f5c21e08897613","The likelihood of experiencing hot extremes has drastically increased due to global warming. Using 554 ground-based air temperature stations, changes in the number of hot days (NHD) in the Chinese mainland during 1960 to 2011 was investigated. We found that the NHD of the current period (1991-2011) was 70% higher than that of the base period (1960-1990). This NHD increment was attributed to the increased summer air temperature mean and its extended hot tail length-defined as the range of the mean and 90th percentile of summer air temperature. To distinguish the relative contribution of air temperature mean and hot tail length change to the NHD occurrence, a numerical-based frame work was proposed. Results showed that global warming (mean temperature increase) contributes approximately 75% of the total NHD increment. Although the average contribution of the hot tail length change is relatively small, it dominates the NHD change in regions where global warming is insignificant, e.g., the central part of China. Results suggest that frameworks and models that fail to capture the air temperature tail changes will result in biased low hot extreme occurrence estimations. This low bias would be particularly significant in regions where the mean temperature change is marginal. Hence, capturing the tail change should be the key model evaluation criterion in regions where the annual mean temperature change is relatively insignificant. © 2019 by the authors.

Yttria (Y2O3)-stabilized zirconia (ZrO2) (YSZ), Ni, and graphene were chosen as additives to enhance the hydriding and dehydriding rates of Mg. Samples with a composition of 92.5 wt% Mg + 2.5 wt% YSZ + 2.5 wt% Ni + 2.5 wt% graphene (designated as Mg-2.5YSZ-2.5Ni-2.5graphene) were prepared by grinding in hydrogen atmosphere. Mg-2.5YSZ-2.5Ni-2.5graphene had a high effective hydrogen-storage capacity of almost 7 wt% (6.85 wt%) at 623 K in 12 bar H2 at the second cycle (n = 2). Mg-2.5YSZ-2.5Ni-2.5graphene contained Mg2Ni phase after hydriding-dehydriding cycling. Mg-2.5YSZ-2.5Ni-2.5graphene had a larger quantity of hydrogen absorbed for 60 min, Ha (60 min), than Mg-2.5Ni-2.5graphene and Mg-2.5graphene.

This situation will lead to a high demand for cereals in the region. At the same time, farmers are experiencing yield losses due to erratic rainfall. To come up with a sound and effective solution, the available but limited water should be used to achieve high yields through irrigation. Therefore, full and deficit irrigation management strategies were evaluated. The expected profit that can be obtained by a smallholder farmer under a conventional irrigation system in the short-term of investment was also assessed considering rope and bucket, treadle pump, and motorized pump water-lifting methods. The study focused on maize in northern Togo. The framework used in this study consisted of (i) a weather generator for simulating long-term climate time series; (ii) the AquaCrop model, which was used to simulate crop yield response to water; and (iii) a problem-specific algorithm for optimal irrigation scheduling with limited water supply. Results showed high variability in rainfall during the wet season leading to significant variability in the expected yield under rainfed conditions. This variability was substantially reduced when supplemental irrigation was applied. This holds for the irrigation management strategies evaluated in the dry season. Farmers'expected net incomes were US$ 133.35 and 78.11 per hectare for treadle pump and rope and bucket methods, respectively, under 10% exceedance probability. The motorized pump method is not appropriate for smallholder farmers in the short run. © 2019 by the authors."

The present study was aimed to assess the validity of the measurement of several BMP as tumor markers aid in detection or staging of breast cancer. These include three types of growth factors: (BMP-2, BMP-7 &BMP-12) besides chitotriosidase enzyme levels in Serum. This study included 66 women with breast cancer. Those patients were categorized into three groups (22 in each group) according to disease stage, in addition to group 4 and chitotriosidase were estimated quantitatively using ELISA kits. Data analysis revealed that although serum levels of studied BMPs were not significantly different among studied groups, serum BMP-7 of patients at stage III presented with significantly higher levels than the controls, while serum BMP-12 levels were lowered significantly at stages I & II breast cancer patients as compared to the controls. Furthermore, elevated serum chitotriosidase levels were only detected at stage III levels only as compared to the controls. Thus both serum BMP-7 and chitotriosidase can be recommended as markers for prognosis of BC to advanced stages (stage III), while serum BMP-12 is recognized as a marker to identify patients with breast cancer at early stages (I & II). © Annals of Tropical Medicine & Public Health S262."

Peacebuilding and imperialism are very different enterprises, but acknowledging their connections enables peacekeepers to draw lessons from the imperial past and better understand its continued implications for the present.

It is assumed that well-balanced pictures are preferred to unbalanced ones. One of the first experimental studies to test this assumption was conducted more than a century ago by Ethel Puffer. By applying a production method, she found little evidence for the hypothesis that balance is favorable for the aesthetical appreciation of pictures. Instead, she observed that other construction principles competing with balance, such as bilateral symmetry and closeness, were applied. The aim of the present study was to repeat some of Puffer's experiments with modern methods and to examine whether her results are replicable. In two experiments, we also found little to no evidence for balance. Moreover, as in Puffer's study, participants used closeness and bilateral symmetry as principles.

We also investigate the normalized/symmetric conditions for operator-monotone functions. These conditions turn out to characterize monotone metrics and Morozowa-Chentsov functions as well.

The spectral analysis of the waste rocks of the Luhansk Region revealed high concentrations of precious, rare-earth, and trace elements. A high prevalence of gallium and germanium clarkes was found, and their actual concentration in the waste was close to the minimum industrial concentration. The results of chemical analysis of the waste rock for Al2O3 showed that its concentration was close to that in poor bauxites, a traditional raw material for alumina. A method and technology of the biochemical leaching of aluminum, gallium, and germanium, which make use of the natural processes of sulfuric acid formation in waste rock were proposed, and their efficiency was experimentally confirmed.

Despite the risk of allograft rejection and the post-operative need for lifelong immunosuppression, facial CTA can be used to restore the normal structural appearance and function of the face. Areas of socioeconomic deprivation and armed conflict zones have a high preponderance of patients with facial burns and other severe injuries. However, these regions often also suffer from lack of resources, expert surgical care and limited facilities. The purpose of this manuscript is to provide a comprehensive review of key principles relevant to facial CTA and their potential applicability in such austere environments. We present a concise literature review of the surgical and immunological basis of facial CTA aimed at the plastic surgery readership, as well as issues surrounding organ transplantations in low-and middle-income countries. We then consider the particular challenges posed by austere settings and countries of active armed conflict and discuss how these may impact the suitability of facial CTA for treating severe facial injuries in these circumstances. Facial CTA is recognised as giving huge benefits for patients with severe facial defects with potentially superior results compared with conventional autograft techniques. Its performance in austere settings is limited by scarce resources and increased pre-, intra-and post-operative risks. However, a case can be made for its use even in these more challenging situations when general organ transplantation compliance and expertise input have been addressed. © 2019, Mediterranean Club for Burns and Fire Disasters.

It is reported that the correct dark energy density emerges using particle physics without fine-tuning. This alone makes the BDE cosmology worthy of further investigation. This work looks at the late-time BDE predictions of the evolution of cosmological parameters and the values of fundamental constants to determine whether the cosmology's predictions are consistent with observation. The work considers the time period between a scale factor of 0.1 and 1.0. A model BDE cosmology is considered with current-day values of the cosmological parameters well within the observational limits. The calculations use three different values of the current-day dark energy equation of state close to −1. All three cases produce evolutions of the cosmological parameters and fundamental constants consistent with the observational constraints. Analytic relations between the BDE and cosmological parameters are developed to insure a consistent set of parameters. © 2019 The Author(s)"

Using fingerprinting ERIC-PCR analysis, 57isolates of A. baumannii were clustered into 2 groups while the remaining 3 were single isolates. The genetic linking of A. baumannii isolated from different hospitals inpatients was high, indicating horizontal gene transfers within hospitalized patients. Conclusion: Our findings indicated accurate and fast diagnosis method to detect virulent A. baumannii isolates harboring differing sets of QS by using blaOXA-51 gene and ERIC-PCR for genetic variations, respectively, possible to be helpful with epidemic infections. © Annals of Tropical Medicine & Public Health S269."

It states that Africa’s transcontinental and transnational migratory phenomena from the medieval period to the post-modern era were a two-way street. While Africans migrated abroad, the continent has also continuously served as a magnet for migrants from other continents. Thus, despite the exaggerated portrayal of African migration to Europe and North America, the available data sources show that transcontinental and transnational African migration is microscopic compared to the global migratory trend. © 2019, SETA Foundation.

Required conditions on spaces are also given, guaranteeing the existence and uniqueness of solutions. The fractional powers of the involved operator BX have been investigated in the space which consists of continuous functions u on [0, ∞) without assuming u(0) = 0.

The recent growth rate has been around 3 percent, which is similar to that in many advanced countries. According to growth accounting, economic growth is possible because of input increases and productivity increases. Productivity growth is much more important than input increases for long-term economic growth. We investigated whether there was a structural break in the Korean manufacturing industry and whether the main factor contributing to economic growth shifted from input to productivity. Using various econometric methods, we tested this question and found some interesting results. First, there was an important change in the 1990s, and the productivity trend seemed to show a big structural break at that time. Second, an input increase was the main factor contributing to economic growth before the break and productivity became more important after the break. Third, there was also a major change in the relationship between international trade and productivity. © 2020 East Asian Economic Association and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd"

This triggers the construction of dynamical network models to investigate how the rhythms interact with each other. Recently, an approach concerning neural path pruning has been proposed in a dynamical network system, in which critical neuronal connections are identified and adjusted according to the pruning maps, enabling neurons to produce rhythmic, oscillatory activity in simulation. Here, we construct a sort of homomorphic functions based on different rhythms of neural firing in network dynamics. Armed with the homomorphic functions, the pruning maps can be simply expressed in terms of interactive rhythms of neural firing and allow a concrete analysis of coupling operators to control network dynamics. Such formulation of pruning maps is applied to probe the consolidation of rhythmic patterns between layers of neurons in feedforward neural networks. © 2019 by the authors."

And if so, how? Drawing on observational and experimental evidence from Brazil’s local elections (2004–2016), I provide evidence that voters use shared class to draw inferences about a candidate’s type: candidates from different classes receive similar overall levels of support, but receive disproportionate support from voters who share their class. The mechanisms driving this finding vary by a voter’s relative class position: upper-class voters use shared class to draw inferences about a candidate’s quality, trustworthiness, and distributive commitments, but lower-class voters only use shared class to draw inferences about a candidate’s trustworthiness and distributive commitments. © 2019, Helen Kellogg Institute.

This paper analyzes the most significant properties of the Caputo matrix exponential, in particular those related to its inverse.

It is argued that the long-established psychological theories of art do not account properly for the observable variability of art, which provide the phenomena of interest whose psychological factors need to be discovered. The general purpose principles of such theories, the ensuing selective sample of art phenomena, and assumption of conventional properties of aesthetic experience make the predictions and the findings of the theories unrepresentative of art. From the discussion of examples drawn from contemporary visual arts and the presentation of the debate on the emergence of the cognitive capacities of art in paleoanthropology, a construct is presented on the specificity of the cognitive capacities of art and its anchoring to perception, which solves the puzzle and has implications for research and teaching psychology of art. © MDPI AG.

With the data from that publisher excluded, the average copyright renewal rate dropped to 10%, meaning that a significant number of maps copyrighted in the United States in the first half of the 20th century are probably in the public domain due to lack of copyright renewal.

Such estimates are not proposed in the approaches using Taylor expansions of higher order derivatives which may be nonexistent or costly to compute. In this sense we can extend usage of the methods considered, since the methods can be applied to a wider class of functions. Numerical testing on examples show that the present results can be applied to the cases where earlier results are not applicable.

Building on this insight, this essay argues that Saudi artists, who have among the largest followings on the country's social media, have used the online public sphere to build a new social movement. They have adopted a role akin to Antonio Gramsci's concept of organic intellectuals-namely, men and women who are not part of the traditional intellectual elite, but who, through the language of culture, articulate feelings and experiences the masses cannot easily express. To paraphrase Ezra Pound, Saudi artists are the antennae of the kingdom's society, whose work is not mere self-expression, but, in the words of Marshall McLuhan, the distant early warning system that can always be relied upon to tell the old culture what is beginning to happen to it.

Our multivariate analyses focus in on the relationships between diet quality and sociodemographics, homemakers' time use, and household technology. We conclude that the typical Upstate New York diet of the 1930s was not of high quality, but improvements had occurred by the early 1950s.

One method is based on the interpretation of kinetic equation for empirical distribution function density as a reduced description of statistical mechanics for appropriate dynamical system. For example, if distribution function density is satisfied to Liouville equation with some velocity, then this velocity can be treated as an average velocity of particle in phase space. The second method is based on the so-called Chernoff theorem from the group theory. According to the consequence from this theorem some iteration procedure exists for construction of group or semigroup, which is equivalent in some sense to average shift generator over the trajectory of appropriate dynamical system. Connection between these two methods enables us to construct a strict approach to nonstationary time series modeling with non-parametric estimation of statistical properties of corresponding sample distribution function. Also the notion of Chernoff-equivalent semigroup can be used for the calculation optimization procedure. © 2019, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd."

Planetary formation is modelled by a solid core accretion scenario, with the core growing in oligarchic regime. The initial superficial density of planetesimals is proportional to the initial superficial density of gas in the disc. We include a numerical approach to describe the evolution of the eccentricity and the inclination of planetesimals during the formation. This approach impacts directly on the accretion rate of solids. When the core reaches a critical mass, gas accretion begins, following the original FARGO scheme adapted to the FARGO3D code. To exemplify how the module for planetary formation can be used, we investigate the migration of a planet in a 2D, locally isothermal gas disc with a prescribed accretion rate, analysing the time-scale involved in the planetary migration process along with the time-scale for planetary formation. The analysis reveals that the mass of the nucleus must be close to its critical value when crossing the ice line to avoid the planet's fall into the stellar envelope. This will allow enough time for the planet to initiate runaway gas accretion, leading to a rapid mass increase and entering type II planetary migration. © 2019 The Author(s)"

Binding of the complex to DNA has been investigated by absorption spectroscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy, and agarose gel electrophoresis. Spectrophotometric studies have showed that the mode of binding is intercalation with a binding constant Kb of 1.25 × 103 L mol–1. Additionally, the complex could quench an ethidium bromide-DNA complex. The apparent binding constant value for the complex is 1.89 × 10 5 L mol–1, which is slightly lower than the classical binding constant of 107 L mol–1. In addition, the quenching mechanism of the complex has been not static or dynamic. Agarose gel electrophoresis has shown that the complex cleaved circular pBR322 plasmid DNA to both nicked and linear forms; at higher concentrations and longer reaction times, the cutting results have been improved. The cleavage mechanism between the complex and plasmid DNA may involve singlet oxygen and hydroxyl radical as reactive oxygen species. © 2019, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd."

A new tetrahedral discretization methodology of three-dimensional (3D) RF is proposed based on the local average (LA) theory. An analytical formula and a numerical formula of the covariance for any two tetrahedral RF elements are developed. Its main advantage, compared to similar studies employing hexahedral discretization method, is that tetrahedral LA method can perfectly combine with tetrahedral finite element (FE) method. Also, the corresponding relation between RF mesh and FE mesh is clearer and the computer codes are simpler. The accuracy of proposed LA method in this study was verified by comparing with other discretization techniques of RF. Finally, an illustrative example is presented to demonstrate the analysis process. The validity and the advantage of the proposed LA method are proven. Taking the spatial variations of uncertain mechanical parameters into account, the stochastic effects of scale of fluctuation on the RF are estimated. The proposed method can be widely applied to 3D stochastic FE analysis, and the sample results will improve our understanding of the stochastic influence of scale of fluctuation on the RF. © 2019 World Scientific Publishing Europe Ltd."

This makes it possible to determine properties of molecules, predict the correct arrangement of protein chains, find the best molecular docking for complex formation, verify hypotheses concerning the protein design, and solve other problems arising in modern drug development. In the case of low-molecular compounds (consisting of less than 250 atoms), the problem of finding the geometry that minimizes the energy function is well studied. The minimization of macromolecules (in particular, proteins) consisting of tens of thousands of atoms is more difficult. However, a distinctive feature of statements of these problems is that initial approximations that are close to the solution are often available. Therefore, the original problem can be formulated as a problem of nonconvex optimization in the space of about 104 variables. The complexity of computing the function and its gradient is quadratic in the number variables. A comparative analysis of gradient-free methods with gradient-type methods (gradient descent, fast gradient descent, conjugate gradient, and quasi-Newton methods) in their GPU implementations is carried out. © 2019, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd."

Input data are a set of level-set functions and a bounding box containing the domain of interest. This geometry definition allows the treatment of edges as intersection curves. Initially, the given bounding box is partitioned with an octree that is used to locate corners and points on the intersection curves. Once a point on an intersection curve is found, the edge is traced. Smooth surfaces are discretized using marching cubes and then merged together with the advancing-front method. The piecewise linear geometry is lifted by projecting the inner nodes of the Lagrangian elements onto the surface or intersection curve. To maintain an accurate mesh, special attention is paid to the accurate meshing of tangential intersection curves. Optimal convergence properties for approximation problems are confirmed in numerical studies. © 2019, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd."

The thickness of images was 3 mm and the interslice gap was 0.3 mm. Performance of MRI imaging was carried out using 1.5 T GE system. According to MRI examination, there were 5 patients with absent olfactory bulb accounting for 25 % and 3 with absent olfactory sulcus accounting for 15 %, as shown in figure 1. Twelve patients had no detectable MRI abnormality and therefore were considered to have idiopathic hypogonadotrphic hypogonadism; where those 8 patients with abnormal MRI findings were considered to have Kallman syndrome. Absent olfactory bulb was significantly asscoaited with anosmia. The principal findings in MRI that differentiate Kallman syndrome from idiopathic hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism are olfactory bulb and sulcus abnormalities that are best visualized using coronal MRI scanning. © Annals of Tropical Medicine & Public Health S249."

In the present study, the cylinders of equal diameter D were fixed at center-to-center gap ratio of T/D = 1.7 and immersed in sub-critical flow of Reynold number ReD = 10, 000. A three-dimensional Navier-Stokes flow solver in an Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) description was closely coupled to a non-linear finite element structural solver that was used to model the dynamics of a composite piezoelectric plate. The cantilever plate was fixed at several positions between 0.5 < x/D < 1.5 and-0.85 < y/D < 0.85 measured from the center gap between cylinders, and their flow-induced oscillations were compiled and analyzed. The results indicate that flexible plates located at the centerline between the cylinder pairs experience the lowest mean amplitude of oscillation. Maximum overall amplitude in oscillation is predicted when flexible plates are located in the intermediate off-center region downstream of both cylinders. Present findings indicate potential to further maximize wake-induced energy harvesting plates by exploiting their favorable positioning in the wake region behind two side-by-side cylinders. © 2019 by the authors."

However, these hyperparameters determine the performance of each method, and it is diffcult to tune them. In this paper, we propose a novel nonparametric tensor completion method, which formulates tensor completion as an unconstrained optimization problem and designs an effcient iterative method to solve it. In each iteration, we not only calculate the missing entries by the aid of data correlation, but consider the low-rank of tensor and the convergence speed of iteration. Our iteration is based on the gradient descent method, and approximates the gradient descent direction with tensor matricization and singular value decomposition. Considering the symmetry of every dimension of a tensor, the optimal unfolding direction in each iteration may be different. So we select the optimal unfolding direction by scaled latent nuclear norm in each iteration. Moreover, we design formula for the iteration step-size based on the nonconvex penalty. During the iterative process, we store the tensor in sparsity and adopt the power method to compute the maximum singular value quickly. The experiments of image inpainting and link prediction show that our method is competitive with six state-of-the-art methods. © 2019 by the authors."

This platform projects a series of graphical patterns on the patient’s retina and calculates the severity of VDs accordingly. The accuracy of this technique relies on the accurate detection of distorted lines by the patient. We also propose a simple mathematical model to evaluate the VD created by CSR. The model is used as a control for the test results achieved from the proposed platform. The proposed platform consists of the required hardware and software for the generation and projection of patterns along with the collection and processing of patients against their standard optical coherence tomography (OCT) images.

It is associated with higher morbidity, prolonged hospital stay, and highermortality. There is also a significant associated economic burden.Syndrome of Inappropriate Anti-diuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) and Cerebral Salt Wasting (CSW) are the main causes of hyponatraemia in the neurosurgical setting. However, adrenal insufficiency, hypothyroidism, medication side effects, and excessive hypotonic intravenous fluid infusion are also all recognised causes of hyponatraemia. Identifying causes of hyponatraemia and clinical differentiation between SIADH and CSW are vital, as they require different management strategies; fluid restriction for the former versus fluids and salts replacement for the latter. This is an observational prospective study that aims to identify the prevalence and the causes of hyponatraemia in post-neurosurgical patients at Macquarie University Hospital, and in particular to differentiate between SIADH and CSW, and document management used. This study was conducted at Macquarie University Hospital from June 2016 to April 2017. Patients were recruited from ICU and the neurosurgical Ward. Inclusion criteria include any patient with serum sodium <135 mmol/L following pituitary, cerebral or spinal surgery. Patients with prior hyponatraemia, fluid overloadstatessuch as heart failure, liver cirrhosis, and patients on medications that can cause hyponatraemia, for example, thiazides, carbamazepine, haloperidol, and furosemidewere excluded from this study.Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS Version 24; student t-test was used with a P value <0.05 considered as significant. Total 38 patients in total were recruited. The prevalence of hyponatraemia in post-neurosurgical intervention was 6.1%. Most of the patients were asymptomatic. We classified the hyponatraemic patients according to aetiology into five groups: 16 patients with SIADH (42.1%), 15 unclassified patients (39.5%), 3 patients with CSW (7.9%), 3 patients with adrenal insufficiency (7.9%), and one patient with hypothyroidism (2.6%). Despite the fact that both clinical and biochemical parameters of SIADH and CSW were quite similar, we could differentiate between the two conditions depending on the state of dehydration (P-value<0.01). Hyponataremia is common following neurosurgery. It is often multifactorial, and it is essential to identify the aetiology of hyponatraemia in each individual patient in order to address the appropriate treatment. SIADH is the commonest cause of hyponatraemia, followed by unclassified cases, CSW, adrenal insufficiency, and hypothyroidism. Fluid restriction is the most common treatment modality for treating hyponatraemia, yet it can not be used in all cases. It can cause deleterious consequences in patients with CSW, and adrenal insufficiency as patients in these categories are volume depleted. © Annals of Tropical Medicine & Public Health S251."

In order to address this, endocytosis was identified as the cellular mechanism that allowed trehalose entry. The cellular machinery behind endocytosis is complex and required inhibitors to reveal a specific mechanism that facilitates the entry of trehalose. This study, therefore, used human dermal fibroblast cultured and incubated in different trehalose extracellular concentrations and incubation times. The trehalase-based assay was used to calculate the intracellular trehalose and FITC was used to indicate the trehalose entry in a PKH26 membrane-stained fibroblast. Pitstop-2, dynasore and cytochalasin-D were used to inhibit trehalose entry. Cryopreservation used the slow-freezing method using the trehalose as cryomedium. Intracellular trehalose was accumulated in a time and concentration-dependent manner. Pitstop-2, dynasore, and the combination of both inhibitors reduced as much as 60% of the trehalose entry. Cytochalasin-D also reduced the trehalose entry in a dose-dependent manner. Additional pre-treatment incubation time and extracellular trehalose in cryomedium provided increased protection of the cryopreserved fibroblast in the trehalose. The presence of trehalose on both sides of the membrane also improved cellular adhesion. In conclusion, pitstop-2 and dynasore reduced the trehalose entry, indicating a clathrin-mediated mechanism. However, clathrin-independent, dynamin-independent, and actin engagement were also involved in facilitating trehalose entry. © Connect Journal."

Patients were well educated about the therapeutic profile of rituximab, including both risks and benefits. Enrolled patients: Male or female patients ≥ 18 years with active RA for at least 6 months before the study, inadequately responded to methotrexate therapy. The disease activity was assessed by measuring Disease Activity Score (DAS28). Indication of disease activity was swollen joint and tender joint count ≥ 8 and DAS28-ESR >5.1. Patients were excluded if: < 18 years or over 65 years, concomitant treatment with any DMARDs (other than methotrexate), chest infection, tuberculosis, hepatitis, diabetes, low immune patients, pregnant or breast feeding women. A detailed history and complete physical examination in all patients preceded rituximab therapy. The treatment included rituximab(MabThera1000mg) infusion on days 1 and 15 in addition to methotrexate. Patients were assessed at baseline, at the follow-up at 2 and 12 weeks post treatment, for disease activity score and for the safety outcomes. Remission rate was defined as DAS-28 < 2.6, swollen joints< 4, tender joints< 2,pain score <10 mm and ESR less than 20 mm/h. Sixty three patients with active RA were enrolled, aged 18 - 65 years. The durationof the disease was 0.6 - 30 years. Rheumatoid factor was positive in 59% of patients. The reduction in mean DAS28 and its component was highly significant (P <0.0001) over the time. The reduction in mean DAS28 was highly significant (P < 0.0001) over the time. It was higher at the baseline (9.6) compared with the its value (4.6) after first dose and (2.7) second dose, respectively. The disease activity suppressed in 96% of patients within 3 months, the remission was achieved in 50% of patients and 46% patients achieved low disease activity. While only 2 patients showed persistent disease activity (DAS >5.1). Of note, joint pain, and swelling were improved and most patients reduced their analgesic intake. Regarding the safety, the most commonly observed adverse events were infusion related reactions. They were developed in 29% of patients during the first infusion. They included, throat irritation, urticaria/rash, flushing and headache. They were mild to moderate in severity. 8% of patients showed immediate improvement after the symptomatic treatment. While13 patients experienced serious infusion related reaction, consisted mainly of anaphylactic reactions, dyspnea, chest pain, tachycardia, tingling, edema, elevated blood pressure. As a result, the infusion were definitively stopped and these patients were withdrawn from the study according to the physician decision. Interestingly, subsequent infusion was well tolerated. Furthermore, no infections were noted during the period of study and no deaths were related to this outcome. Conclusion: B-cell depletion therapy is valuable in suppressing disease activity and improving outcome in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis. Rituximab in combination with methotrexate represents a safe alternative option for patients that fail to respond to other therapy, with no major adverse effects. Infusion related reaction is considered to be a main disadvantage; however, its incidence is lowered with corticosteroid pretreatment and with subsequent infusions. © Annals of Tropical Medicine & Public Health S285."

Therefore, it is necessary to find a balance between them, i.e., to let the pupils discuss the problems while supporting the teacher's intervention. The aim of the presented study was to examine the influence of a teacher's progressiveness on the level of metacognitive knowledge of the pupil. Altogether, 47 teachers and 278 pupils at grade 5 were participating in the study. It is shown that the approach of teachers to innovation itself has an influence on the pupil. When comparing all five groups of innovators, the difference among the categories of teachers was significant (p = 0.044) with the low effect (dcohen = 0.3). When considering only the two almost antagonistic poles of teachers, the innovators and the late majority according to Roger's innovation diffusion theory, this influence was very strong (p = 0.009) and with medium effect (dcohen = 0.725). Our research shows that it is necessary to address the teacher's innovativeness, affecting the level of metacognitive knowledge of the pupil as an important prediction tool determining school success. © 2019 by the authors."

Transmission line system with voltages ranging from 66 kV to 1200 kV have been designed and constructed in the last few years. There have been a number of occasions where high voltage line such as 765 kV D/C line has to cross another high voltage line and to make crossing arrangements availability of space to erect tower sometimes is not adequate. This situation possesses a big challenge and demands to design and develop a special kind of tower with a narrower base width and a taller height required for crossing along with the special design considerations. These kind of high voltage towers are then easily accommodated in the narrow space and are tall enough to cross the intercepting line. These transmission lines also pass through some major rivers which are having width ranging from 1-1.5 km. India is blessed with huge network of rivers, mainly carrying water from mountains and is mostly perennial in nature. Most of the times the water flows throughout the year in the rivers and it becomes difficult to spot any tower with deep foundation in the mid-stream. Further, as most of the rivers are navigable, therefore to maintain adequate electrical clearances and to account for long span and huge sag, the height of tower goes up to 170-180 m. Accordingly special considerations are then followed for the design of such long slender towers. Furthermore, there have been numerous occasions when lines are to be terminated at substations with very limited available corridor/severe space crunch as already many existing lines are terminating at the substation. These lines occupy most of the corridor and there is hardly any space left to accommodate any new line. In one of the case, a line was required to be terminated in the substation with no any corridor as available space between the two existing line was already occupied by another tower which was to be used to cross the existing lines at the same place. Due to the severe space crunch near substation, a special kind of tower has to be designed. The paper covers in detail, salient design aspects and other special design features of narrow base towers 765 kV D/C DDN+55 & 800 kV DDN+60, 765 KV D/C river crossing towers and special Power line crossing tower designed for site specific requirement. © 2019, Central Board of Irrigation and Power.

We find that the wavelength range coverage will soon no longer be a problem. An effective temperature computed by integrating the spectroscopic observations of the James Webb Space Telescope will give uncertainties similar to, or better than, the current state-of-the-art, which is to fit models to data.

The actuator design is unique as it implements a free-piston complaint architecture where the piston is free to move in a linear direction. Our objective is to study the actuator behavior in both the cycles to help identify the benefits and highlight the differences between the two cycles. The actuator is modeled as a spring-mass-damper system by taking an air standard cycle approach. Three observations are reported: (1) for nominal heat inputs (140 J/cycle), the actuator can produce large displacement strokes (16 cm) that is suitable for driving mesoscale robots; (2) the efficiency of the actuator depends on the heat input; and (3) for a specific heat input, both the open and closed cycles operate differently-with different stroke lengths, peak pressures, and thermal efficiencies. Our study reveals that the performance metrics of the actuator make it an ideal candidate for high speed, large force, and large displacement stroke related applications. © 2019 by the authors."

Among 82 β - thalassaemia (56 BTM and 26 BTI) tested, the observed C282Y, H63D and S65C allele frequency were 4.46%, 15.1% and 1.7% respectively in β-thalassaemia major, 1.9%, 11.5% and 2% respectively in β-thalassaemia intermediate and 2%, 6% and 0.0% respectively in the control group. The S65C was uncommon or rare and we found one subject heterozygous for S65C mutation in BTI and two in BTM. We did not observe any subject with compound heterozygote mutation. Conclusion: We observed that there was not a statistical significance correlation between the Hepcidin levels and the presence of HFE mutations (p value = 0.10).The controversies about the relation between HFE mutations and hepcidin in iron overload β- thalassaemia patients still need more studies considering novel factors and mutations involved in such mechanisms such as ferroportin, hemojuvelin, β-globin, and transferrin receptor-2 (TFR2). © Annals of Tropical Medicine & Public Health S275."

Considering arbitrary positive integers n and N with n ≤ N and N ≥ 2, the new explicit expression of displacement function for the four-dimensional system is detected by introducing the technique on power trigonometric integrals. Then some precise and detailed results in comparison with the existing works, including the existence condition, the exact number, and the parameter control conditions of periodic solutions, are obtained, which can provide a new theoretical description and mechanism explanation for the phenomena of emergence and disappearance of periodic solutions. Results obtained in this paper improve certain existing results under some parameter conditions and can be extensively used in engineering applications. To verify the applicability and availability of the new theoretical results, as an application, the periodic solutions of a circular mesh antenna model are obtained by theoretical method and numerical simulations. © 2019 by the authors."

The prepared materials were systematically characterized by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy and N2 physisorption measurements. The results reveal an excellent adsorption capacity of CO2 by calcined Mg-Al hydrotalcite; however, when this adsorbent was treated by ball-milling for 2 h, a slight decrease in its CO2 adsorption capacity was observed, mainly attributable to the decreased surface area, total pore volume, pore size and the formation of particle aggregates of the aforementioned hydrotalcite. Therefore, alterations in structure, texture and morphology of calcined Mg-Al hydrotalcite during the ball-milling treatment do not optimize its CO2 adsorption capacity. © 2019, Hanyang University.

The following species categories were predefined: all species, conifers, hardwoods, softwoods, and others. The following age groups were predefined: all ages, young growth, middle-aged, pre-mature, with old-growth forests. The correlation and regression analyses were performed for each of the 20 age and species groups of forests. Mean annual temperature, difference between mean July and mean January temperatures, and annual precipitation were independent variables. Mean stock positively correlates with the mean annual temperature and humidity, and negatively correlates with the difference between mean July and mean January temperature. The correlation coefficient between the mean stock and mean annual temperature had a pronounced upward trend across the species groups, as follows by their value: other species, conifers, hardwoods, and softwoods. Multiple polynomial regression equations, which included all possible combinations of independent variables and their quadratic effects, were found for each species and age groups. Determination coefficients had the highest values (R2 > 0.7) for all species, hardwood species, and mature and middle-aged forests of all species and hardwood species. Other wood species and all young growth were the least predictable (R2 < 0.5). The regression equations could be used to forecast changes in the mean growing stock under changing climate for forests overall and their groups of different age and species composition. © 2019, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd."

Does risk perception related to climate change and nuclear energy effect their choices? Does it differ between cities? A comparative analysis was performed for four cities after the accident at the Tokyo Electric Power Corporation's (TEPCO)'s Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant in 2011. This article uses a modeling technique based on surveys gathered in 2012. The results show that nuclear risks had a larger influence than climate-change risks with regards to supporting the deregulation of the electricity sector in TEPCO-serviced cities. Meanwhile, in non TEPCO-serviced cities, nuclear risks were more influential when the proportion of nuclear within the energy mix of the local utility was large. When the proportion was low, climate-change risks had the larger influence. Meanwhile, results from all four cities show that there is indeed a positive causal relationship between citizens' levels of awareness of climate change and energy savings. © 2019 by the authors."

In the summer-run race, one population is known to use a specific type of spawning grounds. The fall-run race includes three populations with different types of spawning grounds. These four populations correspond to four eco-geographical groups separated reproductively by geographical boundaries of the geomorphological zones, as well as temporally and ecologically. In China, chum salmon has not been recorded from the spawning grounds of the Amur basin for already more than 50 years. In the Russian Federation, 100% of summer-run chum salmon spawn completely at parafluvial springs in late July and August; 77.1% of fall-run chum spawn at orthofluvial springs in September–November; 20.4% of fall-run chum spawn in the downstream part of the spawning range at parafluvial springs in September; and 2.5% of fall-run chum spawn in lakes near the Amur River mouth at orthofluvial springs in October and November. © 2019, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd."

Due to the total lack of forest management, the yield obtained from native forests is very low, with highly intervened forests and intense soil erosion. The main contribution of this article is to present, for the first time, a study on the characterization and problems of 211 small forest landowners in this region of Chile. After interviewing the landowners, multivariate analysis techniques were applied to the results of the survey, which enabled four types of SFL to be identified. Differences were found in regard to the surface area of their properties and the products extracted, among others. However, they all had a similar social profile, low education level and little training in forest management, very advanced ages, a lack of initiative to create forest communities, and lack of basic services due to their isolation. The characterization of the SFLs allowed proposals to be designed for future sustainable forest management activities to help mitigate the continuous deterioration of the native forest and obtain products in a sustainable way and with greater yields, considering current legal aspects, access to subsidies, and specific forest training plans for each type of SFL. © 2019 The Author(s)."

An example is an eosinophil, which has a PRR with the ability to recognise DAMPs and produce various cytokines, giving rise to inflammation. Furthermore, an accumulation of uric acid crystals leads to kidney disorders, which are detected using the cystatin C parameter, which is superior to creatinine testing. This study aimed at investigating the correlation between the absolute eosinophil counts with cystatin C levels in hyperuricemia. Data was obtained from a total of 25 men within the age of 18-65 years, living in the city of Tasikmalaya, Indonesia. The selection was based onthose suffering from hyperuricemia, fasting and not obsessed. Uric acid levels mean = 8,928; SD= 1,0450 mg/dl; Absolute Eosinophil Counts mean= 0,3624; SD= 0,18392 × 103/μl; Cystatin C levels mean = 1,0800; SD = 0,17642 mg/dl with the result obtained from the Pearson's Correlation ñ = 0.636, (ñ) = >0.05.

In this case report, we address the feasibility of this procedure. Case summary An 80-year-old patient who presented with presyncope, transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE), and transoesophageal echocardiography (TOE) revealed severe calcific AS and LVOT mass measuring 2.1*1.5 cm. The patient was turned down for surgery. It was decided that transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) be performed because the valve compresses the mass against the proximal part of the interventricular septum. The mass peduncle was 1.4 cm, and it was 4 mm away from the annulus. This meant the valve was needed to be deployed 18 mm below the annulus to cover the mass completely. Gentle manipulation and direct valve deployment without preballoon dilation to decrease the possibility of fragment embolization were necessary. Self-expandable core valve deployed as low as possible, after initial deployment, the distance of LVOT covered by the valve measured by TOE 1.66 cm, the whole mass was covered, then the valve was fully deployed. The patient was extubated in the catheterization room; there was no clinical evidence of embolization. The patient was discharged home after 2 days. A follow-up TTE after 6 months showed a well-functioning valve and the LVOT mass then disappeared. Discussion Pedunculated LVOT mass should be resected surgically. In high-risk surgical patients, direct TAVI to compress the mass is feasible in experienced canters. The safety issues need more research and more cases to judge. Transoesophageal echocardiography during the procedure is mandatory to guide the valve position. © The Author(s) 2019.

A roving survey was carried out during 2016-2019 to assess the disease incidence in Coimbatore, Tirupur, Dindigul, Theni, Tenkasi, Tirunelveli and Kanyakumai districts. From the results, Cumbum block in Theni district, Tenkasi block in Tirunelveli (Tenkasi) district and Kuruthancode block in Kanyakumari district were identified as hot spot area for root (wilt) incidence. The disease is generally recognized based on leaf symptoms, but the development of foliar symptoms in coconut palms is very slow and there is a time lag between infection and symptom expression. To the confirmation of the latent infection of root (wilt) affected palms, Direct Antigen Coated (DAC) indirect ELISA has been standardized earlier. Since this ELISA system requires 24 hours, a modified protocol was developed using leaf disc as test antigen that was simple, rapid and provide results within 7 hours. The test yielded 98% more sensitivity with respect to the visual observations. The modified protocol is used for the routine screening of coconut palms for selection of disease-free mother palms and for developing root (wilt) resistant varieties. Besides this, the test is used for confirmation of root (wilt) disease in the early stages of the infection and in newly affected areas. The result of the field experiment on root (wilt) management revealed that the soil application of microbial consortia (Trichoderma viride (Tv)+ Pseudomonas fluorescens (Pfi)+ Bacillus. subtilis) at 100 + FYM 5 kg + phosphobacteria at 200 g at quarterly intervals along with copper sulphate at the concentration of 75 g at three months intervals was effective in reducing the disease incidence from 13.33 to 8.13% after two years of treatment. © 2019, Technology Society of Basic and Applied Sciences.

The diagnosis of cardiac tamponade in malignant effusion may be challenging, as the typical echocardiographic signs are not met. Patients with cancer can present with cardiac tamponade in form of tachycardia (rather that hypotension) that improves after pericardiocentesis. Case summary A 70-year-old female patient presented to the emergency department with rapid development of shortness of breath over a week. Her past medical history included oesophageal carcinoma 1 year before presentation. This was complicated by dysphagia for which the patient underwent oesophageal stenting 5 months before admission. On admission, the patient was in respiratory distress, tachycardia; however, she was normotensive. Echocardiography revealed massive circumferential pericardial effusion. Apart from significant respiratory variation in mitral and tricuspid inflow, the echocardiographic features of tamponade were absent. We discuss on how we applied European Society of Cardiology guidelines in order to calculate the pericardiocentesis score and make a firm management plan. Despite that the patient was normotensive, the pericardiocentesis score was 13.5, so urgent pericardiocentesis was done followed by immediate improvement. Discussion This case demonstrates that oncology patients can present with tamponade in the form of tachycardia rather than hypotension as the slow course of effusion formation allows the body to compensate by increasing the heart rate and peripheral vascular resistance, thus maintaining the blood pressure. The application of 'pericardiocentesis score' is very helpful in such patients. Score equal or greater than 6 necessitates urgent pericardiocentesis even if the blood pressure is normal. © The Author(s) 2019.

In the main part of the paper, I elucidate their internal structure and variance by discussing three logical presuppositions: (1) the performance of tyrannical acts, (2) the exclusive targeting of minorities, and (3) collective action by the majority. In the final part, I propose to revalue the concept as an instrument of horizontal accountability among citizens. Antipopulist rather than antidemocratic in nature, it allows the losers of majoritarian decisions to call their fellow citizens to account for the injustices they engender. © 2019, Helen Kellogg Institute.

An implant is defined as a biomaterial which is embedded, either incompletely or totally, into the body for restorative or prosthetic purposes. The aim of current study was to evaluate the effect of plasma nitride treatment of commercially pure titanium dental implant on bond strength at the bone-implant interface by torque removal test and histomorphometric analysis after 2 and 6 weeks in comparison to non-treated one. Methods: Commercially pure titanium plates and screws were plasma nitride treated for 10 hours using glow plasma nitride apparatus. X-ray diffraction analysis and scanning electron microscope examination were carried out on the nitride surfaces of the plates. The femur of 10 white New Zealand rabbits was chosen as implantation sites. The femur of each rabbit received 2 screws and a total of 40 screws were implanted. For each period of time, 18 screws were tested for the torque required to remove the implant from the bone and 2 screws were kept for histological examination. Results: There was a significant increase in the bond strength and the new bone formation ratio of bone-implant interface with time. The torque removal forces for plasma nitride implants after 2 and 6 weeks were 30.22, 59.56 N.cm respectively and for non-treated implants after 2 and 6 weeks were 23.61 and 56.11N.cm, respectively. The new bone formation ratio for non-treated implants after 2 and 6 weeks were 1.56 and 3.04, respectively, and for plasma nitride treated after 2 and 6 weeks were 3.36 and 4.72, respectively. Conclusion: Plasma nitride treatment of commercially pure titanium plate screws significantly increased the torque removal value and new bone formation ratio at 2 and 6 weeks compared with the non-treated implant. © Annals of Tropical Medicine & Public Health S242"

We used drugs narrow therapeutic index (NTI), which is used with caution at a specific and calculated dose because it is life-threatening and has high toxicity. Compared to drugs that have wide therapeutic index (WTI) and less serious effects (such as aspirin, acetaminophen (paracetamol), penicillin, etc.), we selected acetaminophen (paracetamol) in patient research (a wide therapeutic index) and the dose and ratio between the toxic dose and the safe therapeutic dose of the drug, the research focuses on dilution To limit the risk of medication to patients (mortality), which is used as a measure of the relative safety of the drug in a particular drug treatment, our main work is limited to digoxin (cardiac glycosides) used in heart disease, discrimination with other drugs and knowledge, and in comparison to drugs. We used acetaminophen (paracetol) which is a broad indicator, so we based on previous knowledge in clinical pharmacy, dosage medications, therapeutic toxic dose, maximum dose, initial dose, maintenance dose, lethal dose, by knowing Therapeutic index for drug identification, therapeutic index, therapeutic ratio, TI can be calculated as a lethal dose of the drug by 50% of the population (LD50) divided by the minimum effective dose for 50% of the population (ED50), that is, TI = LD50 / ED50. This ""academic"" definition of TI is easier to follow in preclinical trials but opens the door to changing explanations in clinical practice. In fact, the definition of therapeutic and / or toxic effect in humans is highly dependent on the type of therapeutic or toxic effect under study, and the drug is generally considered to have a good safety appearance if its TI values exceed the value of 10. The situation is quite different from so-called narrow TI drugs (NTIDs), Where only a very small set of doses produce a beneficial effect without causing severe and fatal complications, i.e. small differences in their plasma concentrations can lead to inadequate therapeutic response or the appearance of harmful toxic effects. The term “critical dose medication” is sometimes used to refer to drugs where relatively small differences in dosage or concentration may lead to serious therapeutic failure and / or serious drug reactions. Other terms used also include ""narrow therapeutic window drugs"", ""narrow therapeutic range"", ""critical anti-dose drugs"" or ""narrow therapeutic ratio, According to:The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) defines a medication product as containing NTI when (a) there is less than a double difference in LD50 and medium effective dose values (ED50) or (b) there is less than a double difference in toxic concentrations Minimum (MTC) and minimum effective concentrations (MEC) in the blood and (c) safe and effective use of the drug requires careful calibration and patient monitoring 2018. © Annals of Tropical Medicine & Public Health S246"

It preferentially affects the young woman with little or no classical risk factor for atheromatous disease. Case summary In this report, we present a classical non-ST-segment myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) condition in link with a spontaneous coronary artery wall haematoma. A 43-year-old female patient who did not have any risk factors for atheromatous disease presented with NSTEMI. The coronary angiogram (CA) revealed a moderate smooth stenosis of the proximal left anterior descending artery (LAD) that ended just before the take-off of a septal branch. Intracoronary imaging by optical coherence tomography (OCT) visualized a large intramural haematoma reducing the coronary artery lumen. The patient was managed conservatively with antithrombotic regimen, nitrates, and close monitoring with repeated CA. Evolution was favourable despite striking extension of coronary haematoma towards distal LAD. She was then discharged and has been asymptomatic on follow-up visits. Planned repeat CA and OCT at 3 months showed a quite normal coronary artery appearance of the LAD with significant regression of haematoma. Discussion Precise data regarding SCAD epidemiology remains to be determined. The angiographic pattern of our case recalls the Type 2 described by Saw team. But OCT was necessary to confirm the diagnosis. We manage our patient conservatively with close monitoring, as largely suggested by current state of the art, regarding the good haemodynamic status, and absence of ongoing ischaemia despite an evolution severe stenosis. © The Author(s) 2019.

In the present work, graphite surface has been partially oxidized by concentrated hydrochloric acid (37%); then, the graphite oxide surface has been modified by a low-temperature method using sulfur and cobalt atoms to obtain a Co–S–GC catalyst. The current density passing through Co–S–GC catalyst has been higher than that passing through graphite. The novel cobalt-based catalyst has been demonstrated good performance for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) due to the unique bio-inspired structure. The number of electrons transferred for ORR vary from 2.17 to 2.41 in a wide range of over-potentials indicating an effective 2-electron pathway form O2 to H2O2. The Tafel slope (≈30 mV dec–1) indicates significant amount of cobalt oxide on the surface of the catalyst. The catalyst durability test displays a negative shift of only 11.7 mV after 10 000 cycles for its half-wave potential (E1/2). © 2019, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd."

It is a multifactorial disease caused by a complex interaction between environmental and genetic factors. Pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine may have a significant role in this malignancy. Polymorphisms in the promoter region of some cytokine genes can influence the gene expression of these cytokines. This case-control study aimed to dissect the impact of three single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) in the promoter region of IL-2, IL-4 and TNF-α genes in the susceptibility to BCa among a sample of Iraqi patients. This study enrolled 58 patients with histopathologically confirmed BCa, and other 56 age- and sex-matched, family unrelated apparently healthy individuals as a control group. Blood samples as well as demographic and clinical characteristics were collected from each subject, and DNA was extracted from whole blood. Specific sets of primers were used for amplification of gene fragments corresponding to the target SNPs. The genotyping was performed through a direct sequencing. Serum level of IL-2, IL-4 and TNF-α were measured using enzyme linked immune-sorbent assay (ELISA). AG genotype of TNF-α-308 G>A polymorphism showed higher frequency in BCa patients than controls (34.48% vs. 21.43%) with a significant difference (OR=2.6, 95%=1.13-5.9, p= 0.022).Allele analysis of IL-4-590 C>T polymorphism revealed a significantly higher frequency of the mutant allele (allele T) in patients than controls (37.07% vs. 21.43%) (OR= 2.16,95%CI=1.029-4.532, p= 0.039). Median serum level of TNF-α was significantly higher in patients (72.7 pg/mL) than controls (47.3 pg/mL). 12.9-417.4 These data strongly suggest that the significant role of TNF-α-308 G>A and IL-4-590 C>T polymorphisms as a risk factor for Bladder cancer in Iraqi patients.

An effective and safe vaccine remains a high priority. Most HIV vaccine candidates to date have failed to elicit effective immune responses that are necessary to control HIV infection. The results of a promising phase III trial conducted in Thailand using a recombinant canarypox vector vaccine (ALVAC) expressing HIV Gag in combination with recombinant HIV-Env glycoprotein gp120 (AIDSVAX), showed 31.2% efficacy in humans and raised the prospect of a protective vaccine. The most recommended HIV vaccines are focusing on inducing specific CD8+ T as a critical immune response to control progression and dissemination of HIV virus from the site of infection into different mucosal compartments of the body.This study project used influenza viruses as a mucosal live vaccine vector to stimulate effective CD8+ T cell immunity. Recombinant influenza A viruses, H3N2 (HK-X31) and H1N1 (A/PR8/8/34) expressing defined mouse HIV-1 CD8+ T cell epitopes (H-2Kd Gag197-205 and H-2Kd Tat17-25) in the neuraminidase (NA) stalk were generated using reverse genetics and administered as a prime-boost vaccine within various mucosal routes of vaccination, intranasal-intranasal, intravaginal-intravaginal, intranasal-intravaginal and intravaginal-intranasal vaccination in BALB/C mice. Following those prime-boost vaccinations, tetramer and intracellular cytokine staining assays used for the detection of specific CD8+ T cell immune response in harvested organs, spleen, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), mediastinal and inguinal lymph nodes. In addition, mucosal HIV-specific CD8+ T cells were detected using specific anti-mouse CD8α antibodies directed against specific integrins (LPAM-1 and CD103). Moreover, the level of specific cytokines, such as interleukin-15 (IL-15) detected within specific mucosal CD8+ T cells for the detection of the migrated HIV-1 Gag+ CD8+ T cells.Our result showed there was an induction of CD8+ T cells targeted H-2KdGag197-205, compared to no CD8+ T cell responses specific for H-2Kd Tat17-25 in recombined influenza-HIV vaccinated BALB/c mice. Also, comparable HIV and endogenous influenza-specific CD8+ T cell responses following intranasally-intranasally prime-boost vaccination in harvested lymphoid tissues, spleen, bronchoalveolar lavage, and mediastinal lymph nodes compared to inguinal lymph nodes which included a high proportion of specific CD8+ T cell immune response following intravaginal-intravaginal prime-boost infection. Moreover, a proportion of these cells isolated from mice infected with recombinant influenza-HIV vaccine intranasally-intranasally prime-boost expressed mucosal surface integrins, especially LPAM-1(α4β7) of local and distal lymph nodes higher than the levels observed following intravaginal vaccination. In addition, mucosal LPAM-1+HIV-Gag197-205+ CD8+ T cells harvested of intranasal prime-boost vaccinated mice were recognized by a high expression of IL-15 compared to LPAM-1-HIVGag197-205+ CD8+ T cells.We conclude that the intranasal prime-boost vaccination as one of the mucosal routes of vaccination using recombinant influenza viruses as mucosal viral vectors of HIV vaccine in BALB/c mice has an important role in stimulating both specific and mucosal CD8+ T cells within a high level and these cells would be important for migration of mucosal specific CD8+ T cells given the mucosal acquisition of HIV infection and control of HIV-1 virus dissemination through mucosal compartments. © Annals of Tropical Medicine & Public Health S234"

However, its variations have not yet been specifically described in periodontitis. The present study was conducted to use an uniplex 26S rRNA-based amplicons to detect and discriminate Candida using only one pair of ribosomal primers. A total of 50 patients with chronic periodontitis was involved in the study. Pure Candida colonies were isolated from 23 patients and genomic DNA was extracted, and PCR was conducted. Direct DNA sequencing followed by comprehensive phylogenetic analyses were performed to confirm the identity of Candida colonies. Results indicated that the ration of Candida-infected patients was 46%, with a high prevalence of C. albicans, followed by remarkably lower ratios of C. parapsilosis, C. glabrata, C. kefyr, and C. dubliniensis respectively. Phylogenetic analyses indicated obvious discrimination amongst the analyzed Candida species as each observed species occupied a distinctive phylogenetic position. The current results reported a simple, efficient, and low-cost detection of five species of Candida without the need for other costly techniques of molecular screening. The current findings may help dentists to easily take a snapshot of the patterns of Candida infection in periodontitis cases to assess the nature and grade of infection. © 2019 Journal of Bacteriology and Virology."

Ventricular arrhythmias are induced by a change in the myocardial environment altering cardiomyocyte electrophysiology. The substrate for VA includes myocardial scar, electrolyte disturbances, and drugs altering cellular electrophysiology. Case summary Here, we present a case of a 52-year-old man with known ischaemic cardiomyopathy, presenting with VA storms secondary to dapsone, an anti-microbial used in this case for the prophylaxis of pneumocystis pneumonia. This is the first case linking dapsone to the development of VAs. Ventricular arrhythmias storm occurred towards the end of the course of anti-microbial therapy and the patient was referred for sympathectomy. However, following the end of treatment, no further VA occurred and sympathectomy was therefore avoided. Discussion The underlying mechanism for the association between dapsone treatment and VA is unclear and a prolonged QTc was not observed in our case. It is important to recognize that every drug has many physiological effects and in patients with underlying diseases whereby there is already an unfavourable environment, additional drugs can lower the threshold of triggering an arrhythmia and the result can be life-threatening. In a patient with ischaemic cardiomyopathy, where underlying substrate for VA may already exist, the introduction of dapsone could lower the threshold for development of arrhythmia. © The Author(s) 2019.

A high index of clinical suspicion should be present and once the condition is recognized, it should be managed promptly. Paucity of literature on pneumopericardium makes outlining any new case of paramount importance to emphasize the aspects of diagnosis and management of this rare condition. Case summary A 59-year-old woman with severe mitral valve and moderate tricuspid valve regurgitation underwent mitral and tricuspid valve repair with uneventful post-operative in-hospital stay. She presented 10 days after discharge with progressive shortness of breath. Chest X-ray revealed right hydropneumothorax. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) performed in the emergency department showed an apparently small pericardial effusion with patient in supine position; the effusion size increased substantially when imaging in left lateral decubitus, with presence of intrapericardial air bubbles. Computed tomography scan of the chest confirmed the presence of right hydropneumothorax and hydropneumopericardium, with a communicating pleuro-pericardial tract. The patient underwent chest tube placement which successfully decompressed both pleural and pericardial space. Discussion Hydropneumopericardium is a rare post-operative complication. Comprehensive TTE with imaging from multiple acoustic windows is mandatory when evaluating the extent of pericardial effusion. Presence of cardiac tamponade is crucial in determining the management plan. © The Author(s) 2019. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the European Society of Cardiology."

Pain control is important because it is associated with lower level of outcomes and recovery such as delayed functions, poor breast feeding, more risk for postpartum depression with persisting pain. The aim of current study was to use regional anaesthesia under ultrasound guide as a way to decrease the need for more analgesia in postoperative period. Methods: Seventy patients selected for elective Cesarean Section under general anaesthesia prepared for the study at the time before end of effect of anaesthetic drugs. The patients were divided into two groups; ultrasound-guided TAP block (group A) which was done with 20mL lidocaine 1% on each side and the other group (group B) which had been given paracetamol 15mg|kg and diclofenac 75mg intravenously. Numeric rating scale was used to assess pain. Paracetamol was used if the score more than 3 and diclofenac was added when the score more than 6. Patients were monitored for numeric rating scale and whole analgesia utilized for the early 24 hour post-operatively. Results: Regional block with lidocaine decreased pain scores at 0, 2, 4, 6,12 and 24 hours. Also there was a difference in the scores at 0, 2, 4, 6,12 and 24 hours between the two groups. The duration of analgesia in TAP block with lidocaine lasted to about 20-24h. The whole analgesics utilization was also reduced in group A than group B. No complication was seen to TAP block in both the groups. Conclusion: Regional anaesthesia is good to do for patients undergoing surgery to lessen analgesic requirements especially in the early period post-operative with prolonged pain-free time and no extra need for injectable analgesia. Also, it provides better pain scores with less complications following Cesarean Section surgery. © Annals of Tropical Medicine & Public Health S250."

On the background of some theories about the interdependency and complexity of human needs, these new policy directions attempt to mitigate major issues regarding the social development and normal community integration requirements for the members of the society. The present analysis focuses on the political and ideological principles required for promoting some integrated public social policies required for increasing quality of life. A synthetic review is made as regards the profile of social policies in Romania after 1990. The analysis of 30 years of transition highlights a distinct profile of social policies in the framework of the “selected models of country”. The evaluation of the governmental strategies will pursue the impact of public social policies on some vulnerable categories with high marginalization risk. The analysis attempts to identify actual types of risks in relation with the profile of the beneficiaries and their approach by the governance depending on the political options. A long-term time horizon will be considered along with a short-term one for emphasizing the distinct profiles of the public policies, specific to the post-December governments. During the last years, a new trend of social development emphasizes increasingly more frequently in Europe the need of major objectives for a programme of economic growth in agreement with the social and human requirements. Thus, those stages of “economic development per se’’ by disregarding “human presence” could be exceeded. Therefore, the new EU direction for sustainable economic development is centered on “socially inclusive economic growth As such, the new trends within public policies take account also of a wide sphere of non-economic social factors, corresponding proper to the multidimensional profile of the quality of life and human development. © 2019, Editura Lumen.

"The full-reducing Krivine abstract machine KN simulates pure normal-order reduction in lockstep: A proof via corresponding calculus","2019","Journal of Developmental Origins of Health and Disease","0","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85079437208&doi=10.1017%2fS0956796819000017&partnerID=40&md5=fee027526f613490c78dc2c7c581de6a","We exploit the idea of proving properties of an abstract machine by using a corresponding semantic artefact better suited to their proof. The abstract machine is an improved version of Pierre Criguts full-reducing Krivine machine KN. The original version works with closed terms of the pure lambda calculus with de Bruijn indices. The improved version reduces in similar fashion but works on closures where terms may be open. The corresponding semantic artefact is a structural operational semantics of a calculus of closures whose reduction relation is purposely a reduction strategy. As shown in previous work, improved KN and the structural operational semantics 'correspond', i.e. both artefacts realise the same reduction strategy. In this paper, we prove in the calculus of closures that the reduction strategy simulates in lockstep (at every reduction step) the complete and standard normal-order strategy (i.e. leftmost reduction to normal form) of the pure lambda calculus. The simulation is witnessed by a substitution function from closures of the closure calculus to pure terms of the pure lambda calculus. Thus, KN also simulates normal-order in lockstep by the correspondence. This result is stronger than the known proof that KN is complete, for in the pure lambda calculus there are complete but non-standard strategies. The lockstep simulation proof consists of straightforward structural inductions, thanks to three properties of the closure calculus we call 'index alignment', 'parameters-as-levels' and 'balanced derivations'. The first two come from KN. Thanks to these properties, a proof in a calculus of closures involving de Bruijn indices and de Bruijn levels is unproblematic. There is no lexical adjustment at binding lookup, on-the-fly alphaconversion or recursive traversals of the term to deal with bound and free variables as in other calculi. This paper contributes to the framework for environment machines of Biernacka and Danvy a fullreducing open-terms closure calculus, its corresponding abstract machine, and a lockstep simulation proof via a substitution function. © Cambridge University Press 2019."

It is important to identify risk groups for a closer follow up and timely intervention. Objective: The aim of this work is to analyze the impact of clinical and morphological valve characteristics in the development of moderate/severe (significant) aortic valve dysfunction and in the incidence of major cardiovascular events in adults with BAV. Methods: Consecutive patients with diagnosis of non-syndromic BAV (2010-2019) followed up at our institution were incorporated in the study. Clinical and echocardiographic information was prospectively collected. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify clinical and morphological characteristics that predict significant valve dysfunction and major cardiovascular events (death/surgery/aortic syndrome). A p value <0.05 was considered significant. Results: Three-hundred patients (44.3 ± 15.3 years, 71% men), the majority with type I BAV and presence of raphe (79.6% and 77%, respectively) were included. Mean age at diagnosis was 36.3±16.2 years, and 84 patients (31.2%) presented significant aortic valve dysfunction at the onset of the study. Twenty-three patients required cardiac surgery (7.7%) and 3 died (1%) during a follow-up of 4.9±1.7 years.

At the same time, the issue of sustainable chemistry has gained momentum. Bringing both together would result in sustainable pharmacy. Sustainable pharmacy addresses environmental, economical and social aspects of pharmacy. It focuses on environmental issues along the whole lifecycle of a pharmaceutical entity; that is, dealing with resources and energy input and also with waste management, for example, during the synthesis and production of an active pharmaceutical ingredient. Furthermore, it also looks on the compounds themselves and aims to improve the degradability of the compounds after their use in the environment to reduce the environmental risk caused by pharmaceuticals in the environment. Another issue is the people using pharmaceuticals such as pharmacists, medical doctors and patients. How can they contribute to more efficient use of pharmaceuticals with less environmental burden and less risk for drinking water? The design of pharmaceuticals and the practices surrounding the lifecycle of their manufacture and usage are central to minimize their impacts on the environment and increase the sustainability of healthcare.The concept of Cradle-to-cradle design proposed by McDonough and Braungart, could play a key role in redesigning healthcare and reducing its environmental footprint.[1]  © 2019, Indian Pharmaceutical Association.

The work was conducted at a farm located northeast of Moryak-Rybolov Bay during the first 10 days of November 2018. The values of survival and growth rates of scallops on collectors and grow-out cages were determined. The survival rate of the Yesso scallop spat after being transported from Shandong Province, China and seeded in suspended cages was 85%, which is consistent with the regional standard. A high mortality rate of juvenile scallops (56–90%) was recorded in September–November. The mean size (shell height) of hatchery-reared spat in the cages in November did not differ from that of spat on collectors in southern Primorsky Krai. In the waters near Moryak-Rybolov Bay, the growth rate of scallops was somewhat lower than in southern Primorsky Krai but, nevertheless, higher than in Vladimir Bay and Aniva Bay.

A positive correlation has been revealed between the positions of the main peaks in the Raman spectra of garnets and their chemical composition. A method for determining the paragenetic association of garnet inclusions by the Raman spectroscopy data is described. Diamonds with garnet inclusions of eclogite paragenesis are characterized by a high total nitrogen content and medium degree of aggregation, whereas diamonds with garnet inclusions with dunite–harzburgite and lherzolite parageneses are distinguished by a low nitrogen concentration and a wide variation in the degree of nitrogen aggregation. Dependences have also been revealed between the thermal–temporal parameters of diamond formation (according to IR spectroscopy of diamonds) and type of rocks (according to Raman spectroscopy of garnet inclusions). © 2019, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd."

We highlight this case because it represents an uncommon case of three-valve IE in the setting of recent bioprosthetic valve replacement and IVDU, and it raises the need for continued awareness of mental health and drug rehabilitation in the US military veteran population. Case summary A 62-year-old gentleman with recent bioprosthetic AVR presented with dyspnoea and lower extremity oedema and was found to have a heart failure exacerbation. He developed sepsis and was found to have three-valve endocarditis, as well as aortic root abscess and pacemaker lead infection. He was treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics and evaluated for surgical intervention. After discussion with the surgical team, the patient decided not to pursue surgery due to prohibitively high perioperative mortality risk. The patient was transferred to hospice and expired within 2 weeks. Discussion Three-valve IE is sparingly documented in published literature and can be difficult to treat. Providers must be cognizant of prosthetic valve endocarditis as an uncommon but known complication of valve replacement surgery. Intravenous drug use is a common risk factor for endocarditis and is prevalent in the US military veteran population. Prosthetic valve endocarditis should be treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, and in general, if it leads to new significant valvular abnormalities, the valve should be replaced. © The Author(s) 2019.

Application of fibrin glue following conventional trabeculectomy is hypothesized to increase its surgical success rate. This study aimed to investigate the protein profile in self-made fibrin glue which could possibly contribute to wound healing modulation after trabeculectomy. Peripheral blood was obtained from a single donor using citrate phosphate dextrose adenine (CPDA-1) anticoagulant. Fibrin glue was generated from the mixture of fibrinogen and thrombin. Fibrinogen and thrombin were isolated from plasma pellet and calcium chloride (CaCl2) activated platelet rich plasma (PRP) components using gradient centrifugation alongside the single freezethaw cycle technique. Analysis of protein profile was conducted using liquid chromatography - mass spectrometry (LC - MS). Protein identification was obtained from the Universal Protein knowledge base (UniProt). Liquid chromatography - mass spectrometry analysis revealed 139 proteins in the self-made fibrin glue. There were 26 unique proteins related to the wound healing process, including growth factor related proteins, cell adhesion proteins, and platelet related proteins. There were 30 proteins corresponding to extracellular matrix remodeling which consists of 15 proteolysis activation related proteins, 9 proteolysis regulation related proteins, and 6 negative regulation of proteolysis related proteins. Moreover, as it is a biomaterial, our self-made fibrin glue could act as a biological spacer to facilitate aqueous outflow, and its degradation time of 7-14 days could also be taken advantage of. Self-made fibrin glue contains unique proteins which can contribute to wound healing modulation after trabeculectomy. © Connect Journal."

Previous studies have shown that fibroblasts play an important role in post-extractionsocket wound healingby producing the extracellular matrix and collagen fibers that support it. Herbal medicines, such as Shiny bush (Peperomia pellucida L. Kunth) are believed to accelerate the wound healing process. Flavonoids, tannins, terpenoids, carbohydrates and alkaloids, which all haveanti -inflammatory, anti -bacterial and anti-oxidant properties are found in this species. This study therefore determined the effect of herbal plants on fibroblast proliferation in the post-extraction socket healing process. Twenty-Eight Wistar rats were divided into two control and two treatment groups. Shiny Bush extract was given to the treatment group and a placebo gel was given to the control group. The amount of fibroblasts produced was calculated on the third and seventh days after tooth extraction. The number of fibroblasts in the socket after tooth extraction in the treatment group was higher as compared to the control group, both on days 3 and day 7.

In this manner, this paper presents a novel ear representation based on texture analysis framework, which relies mainly on Dual Cross Pattern (DCP) descriptor and Spatial Pyramid Histogram (SPH) method. The features are extracted using DCP descriptor to capture the textural structure then, the SPH of horizontal ear decomposition is applied to obtain the local information. The feature vector representations of ear image are constructed by concatenating all normalized histograms calculated at each level of the SPH method. Experiments conducted on three ear databases (IITDelhi-1, IIT-Delhi-2 and USTB-1) confirm its performance compared to the recent existing methods. © JES 2019."

According to this importance, the present characterizing study was launched to identify the current circulating ticks in this province. Inspection of 196 bovine animals (males and females distributed over different regions and seasons) for the presence of ticks; 54 animals were found to have such parasitic infestation. From those infested animals, 108 adult ticks were collected. Ticks were exposed to a series of morphological identification in the Department of Microbiology and Parasitology, College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Al-Qadisiyah and the Natural History Museum, University of Baghdad. Moreover, genotypic characterization was performed using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method targeting the 18S rRNA gene of 50 ticks. Eight positive PCR products were sent out to sequencing targeting the same gene,thenphylogenetic analysis was conducted to understand the evolution of the ticks. Morphological characterization revealedthat the ticks were from genera; Hyalomma and Rhipicephalus. Significant (p<0.05) differences were detected via the seasonal distribution of tick infestation with the highest rates during summer. No significant (p>0.05) differences were unveiled via the gender or regional distribution of the tick infestation. PCR and the sequencing have confirmed the morphological-based identification,Phylogenetic study findings revealed that the Hyalomma genotypes from the present work were in a high nucleotide sequence matching with a strain of Hyalommatruncatum (KY457496.1) from South Africa and phylogenetic analysis revealed that the Rhipicephalus genotypes from the current study were closely related to a Rhipicephalusturanicus strain sequence (KF958452.1) submitted to The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Israel. The investigation, here, provides confirming data about the presence of the Hyalomma and Rhipicephalus induced infestation in the current city which might give extra evidence about the presence of the CCHF as those ticks, especially Hyalomma, considered as major vectors for the transmission of the virus. © Annals of Tropical Medicine & Public Health S237"

The reactors were made from 200L PE plastic bioreactors. There were 5 different bioreactors, each with a different vent volume. (These were 0%, 2.3%, 3%, 4.3% and 5.7% of bioreactor volume or 0, 1, 2, 4 and 6 PVC pipes of diameter 1¼"", respectively. Each reactor also had a drain. The material to be composted was food scraps ground to a size less than 1.5 cm and mixed with rice husk, ash and saw dust at a ratio of 6: 1: 1 to achieve a C / N ratio of 35: 1. The Intermittently-Fed Composting (FIC) method was used, adding 4.5 kilograms of materials per day until 85 kg was added in total. The experiment was also subdivided into 2 types: bioreactors with added microbes (added-PD2); and those without added microbes (non-PD2). The experiment had a 60-day biodegradation period. Measurements of temperature, moisture content, and pH were taken and compost samples were analyzed for their germination index (GI) and quality, compared with Thailand compost standards. The results showed that the optimum air volume for composting was 3% of bioreactor volume, or 2 pipes. The composting time was 19 days with the highest temperature of 57-58°C and the temperature was held constant for 33 days. The organic waste decomposition and curing took a total of 57 days, with a GI value between 79-81% and the quality of the resulting fertilizer complied with standards. The main minerals in the compost were N, P and K, which were 1.25%-1.32%, 0.69%-0.76% and 0.93%-1.88%, respectively. It is concluded that different ventilation ratios affect the results for the decomposition of organic matter, with optimal ventilation being 3.0% of bioreactor volume or 2 pipes.

The prognostic value of LSS in asymptomatic severe aortic stenosis (AoS) is under discussion. Objetive: The aim of this study was to assess whether LSS assessment using velocity vector imaging (VVI) predicts the progression and indication of aortic valve replacement (AVR) in asymptomatic patients with severe AoS and preserved EF. Methods: The study included patients with severe AoS and preserved EF who were considered asymptomatic and without initial indication for AVR. They underwent two, three and four-chamber echocardiography that evaluated LSS of each segment and global longitudinal strain (GLS) by VVI, as well as NT-proBNP assessment. The primary endpoint was need for AVR. Results: A total of 57 patients with mean age 69±8 years, 49% women, were included in the study. After two years of follow-up, 13 patients (22.8%) required AVR. This group had lower GLS (-15.5±3.4 vs.-18.9±3.1, p=0.03) and two-chamber LSS (-12.8±5.5 vs.- 16.3±5.6, p=0.04). In univariate analysis, GLS, NT-proBNP and the E/e’ ratio were predictors of the endpoint, while in the multivariate analysis, only GLS was an independent predictor of need for AVR (HR: 1.28 (95% CI 1.04-1.58), p=0.01).

Globally tuberculosis is the commonest aetiology of constrictive pericarditis. Though normally considered to be an irreversible pathology; which requires surgical pericardiectomy, in early stage of the disease antitubercular therapy (ATT) along with steroids and other anti-inflammatory therapy can reverse the pathology. But, complete reversal of constrictive physiology with ATT without any anti-inflammatory drugs is not documented. Case summary Here, we describe a case where a 54-year-old lady presented with progressive dyspnoea and pedal oedema for 2 years along with anorexia and weight loss for two months. Two-dimensional echocardiography and computed tomography scan was suggestive of constrictive pericarditis. In view of systemic features and high acute phase reactants, patient was started on oral ATT without any steroids. After 4 months, constriction physiology was completely reversed. Discussion Constriction physiology if treated timely can be largely reversed only with ATT without adjuvant anti-inflammatory therapy. Further studies are required to find out the specific indications of anti-inflammatory therapy in tubercular constrictive pericarditis. © The Author(s) 2019.

Therefore, the tip of the catheter should be located in the superior vena cava. The location can be monitored by electrocardiography or X-ray. The central venous pressure curve is displayed on the monitor. The reference value of central venous saturation is >70%. Venous pO2 is normally 35-45 mmHg and central venous pressure 1-9 mmHg. Case summary We treated a 22-year-old patient with septic shock. Central venous saturation was 100% with a pO2 of 198 mmHg. The arterial blood gas analysis was comparatively low with saturation of 98% and pO2 of 111 mmHg. On chest X-ray, the central venous catheter tip appeared on the left side of the heart. On echocardiography, aortic positioning was not evident. On the monitor, a 'venous pressure-like' curve was seen, that did not stand in exact correlation to the electrocardiogram curve. The computed tomography (CT) image showed placement of the catheter in the upper left pulmonary vein. The patient had a partial anomalous pulmonary venous return. Discussion The C-wave of the central venous pressure curve normally occurs after the R-wave of the electrocardiogram. If C-waves appeared before R-waves, the central venous catheter placement is not central venous and must be checked. In our case, the apparent 'venous' pO2 in blood gas examination was higher than arterial pO2. The catheter position had to be in an oxygenated vessel proximal to the left ventricle. A vascular anomaly was a possible diagnosis and was confirmed on CT imaging. © The Author(s) 2019."

The gonadotropins which are most frequently used during COS/ICSI cycles are r-FSH and r-HMG (FSH+LH). Over many years, outcomes achieved with using both gonadotropins during COS have been compared and the superiority of using both or only r-FSH is still a controversial topic that necessitates further studying. The aim of this research is to study the effectiveness of adding r-HMG to r-FSH on ICSI outcome in infertile patients who underwent COS. Fifty infertile couples were included who attended fertility clinic due to either female factor or male factor infertility and all of them were treated by ICSI and subjected to COS by r-FSH with or without r-HMG. ICSI outcome was assessed in the form of the total number of retrieved oocytes, FR, CR, embryo quality and chemical PR.The study showed that there was no significant difference between using both gonadotropins or FSH alone regarding the total number of oocytes produced, fertilization rate (FR), cleavage rate (CR), embryos number and quality except pregnancy rate (PR) which was lower with adding r-HMG 41.66% VS 50 % with r-FSH alone. We concluded that the combined use of r-HMG+r-FSH is effective as r-FSH alone in terms of oocytes' and embryos' quality while the effect on PR is still undetermined. © Annals of Tropical Medicine & Public Health S232"

When cooled down, this phase solidifies as interconnected hard and brittle material consisting of a continuous network of Fe2B borides formed at the grain boundaries. To increase ductile behaviour, a change in precipitates' stoichiometry was investigated by partially replacing iron borides by titanium borides. The powder of elemental titanium was introduced to blend of iron and boron powders in order to induce TiB2 in situ formation. Titanium addition influence on microstructure, phase composition, density and mechanical properties was investigated. The observations were supported with thermodynamic calculations. The change in phase composition was analysed by means of dilatometry and X-ray diffraction (XRD) coupled with thermodynamic calculations. © 2019 by the authors."

It is sometimes referred to as silent disease due to its asymptomatic obsolescence until first fracture occurs. Current study was conducted to study the effect of vitamin D using a clinical dose of this vitamin given twice a day to osteoporosis patients in the city of Tikrit and from both sexes who visit Dr. Abdulrazzaq Mahmood Al-Khattabi's clinic and Salahuddin General Hospital. Methods: The research involved 86 subjects (26 males and 60 females) aged between (25-79) years to study the clinical effect of vitamin D on them. In addition, 36 subjects (20 males and 16 females) aged between (25-79 years) of healthy persons were recruited as a control group. The research subjects were divided into two groups; the first of which included the age group (25-54) years while the second included the age group (65-79) years. They were each given a dose of (5000IU) of vitamin D and a dose of (500mg) of calcium twice a day, in the morning and in the evening, for three months with follow-up of subjects periodically each month to observe the changes by measuring a number of biochemical parameters represented in the examination of bone density, vitamin D, serum calcium, serum alkaline phosphatase and C-Reactive Protein. Patients with rheumatism, taking cortisone or any item containing it, and pregnant women were excluded from this research. Results: The results shown a significant increase in bone density in both groups and for both sexes as well as higher levels of vitamin D and calcium compared to the control group.

The following four types of nucleation centers exist in a sample with two ferromagnetic layers of different thicknesses: P+ centers correspond to the regions where the magnetizations of the thick and thin Co layers are directed along an applied field (↑↑); P– centers are the regions where the magnetizations of the layers are opposite to an applied field (↓↓); and AP+ and AP– centers correspond to the regions where the magnetizations of the thick and thin Co layers are opposite to each other and the total magnetic moment is along (↑↓) or opposite to (↓↑) an applied field, respectively. P– nucleation centers are found to be surrounded by AP+ regions in any field and exhibit a monotonic field dependence of their boundary. The field dependence of the growth rate of AP– nucleation centers is nonmonotonic since, as the field increases, they are surrounded by AP+ nucleation centers, AP+ and P– regions, and only P– nucleation centers in strong fields. © 2019, Pleiades Publishing, Inc."

Previous studies have noted a relationship between WP and depression, but there have been a lack of empirical studies investigating this relationship. This study aimed to examine the moderating effect of gender in the relationship between depression and WP in insomnia patients. MethodsaaParticipants consisted of 78 adults (men = 52.6%, women = 47.4%), who met DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for insomnia disorder. All participants completed the Korean version of Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale-Revised (K-CESD-R) and sleep diaries for a week. WP behavior was calculated based on sleep diary data using the difference in time between wake time and time out of bed. Weekday and weekend sleep diary data were analyzed separately, as many individuals display different sleep behaviors on the weekend compared to the weekdays. ResultsaaResults indicated a significant positive relationship between WP and depression (r = 0.335, p < 0.01).

Methods: Ninety-six patients with coronary angiography indication were enrolled in the study: 20 with non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome, 15 with chronic angina, 31 with ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome and 30 asymptomatic patients. After echocardiography with ECS and correlation with coronary artery disease, patients were classified into 2 groups according to ECS ≤1 or ECS ≥2. Results: Among the total number of patients, 23 patients without lesions had ECS: 0.61 and 73 with lesions had ECS: 2.63. In patients presenting lesions, 16 had single lesion with ECS: 1.68 and 57 multiple lesions with ECS: 2.87. In the 23 patients without lesions, 20 had ECS ≤1 and 3 ECS ≥2, and among the 73 patients with lesions, 13 had ECS ≤1 and 60 ECS ≥2. Thus, ECS ≥2 presented a higher frequency of coronary artery disease vs. ECS ≤1 (p <0.05), with 82.2% sensitivity, 87% specificity, 95.2% positive predictive value and 60.6% negative predictive value. In single vs. multiple lesions, 9 out of 16 patients with single lesion had ECS ≥2 and 51 out of 57 patients with multiple lesions had ECS ≥2, with 89.5% sensitivity and 43.8% specificity to identify multi-vessel disease, and 85% positive predictive value and 53.8% negative predictive value.

To verify their structure, ten solid uranyl nitrate specimens with various enrichment values (0.1 % to 1 %) were analyzed. The used samples have different numbers of hydrated water molecules; consequently, the properties of these materials in analytical chemistry and computational methods are not the same. Scanning electron microscope and energy dispersive X-ray are used in this work to visualize and analyze the sample of hexahydrate uranyl nitrate (natural 0.72 %). The specimen has been screened under optimal microscopy circumstances. In spite of the reliability of these tools, they are not accurate, particularly when carrying out complete qualitative and quantitative analysis. With the aid of the Monte Carlo code (MCNP-5), the approach presented here can resolve the limitations that tackle the microscope and X-ray test-ing.

Analytical calculation of added mass effect due to lead bismuth eutectic and verification through previously presented theories, has been established. The integrity of the hexagonal wrapper of fuel assembly has been guaranteed over the entire operating temperature range. Effect of temperature on the density of lead bismuth eutectic, the subsequent change in added mass of lead bismuth eutectic, the effect on natural frequencies and effect on stresses on wrapper, has been studied in detail. A simple empirical relationship is presented for estimation of added mass effect for lead bismuth eutectic type fast reactors for any desired temperature. An approach for assess-ment of fast reactor fuel assembly performance has been outlined and calculated results are presented. Nuclear seismic rules require that systems and components which are important to safety, shall be capable of bearing earthquake effects and their integrity and functionality should be guaranteed. Mode shapes, natural frequencies, stresses on wrapper and seismic as-pect has also been considered using ANSYS. Modal analysis has been compared in vacuum and lead bismuth eutectic using the calculated added mass. © 2019, Vinca Inst Nuclear Sci. All rights reserved."

However, the protective properties of water-based paints are inferior to those of solvent-based paints and so new ways to increase the resistance of water-based systems are sought. The present contribution describes the preparation and testing of environmentally friendly anti-corrosion paints based on novel water-based self-crosslinking acrylate latexes containing appropriate pigments and ZnO or MgO nanoparticles at a concentration of 1.5 % (with respect to the monomers) compared to the same systems free from the nanoparticles. Both the effect of the MeO nanoparticles and the effects of the pigment species and particle shapes on the paint film properties were examined. The MeO nanoparticles were found to improve all the properties tested. The latexes with MgO exhibited the highest resistance to flash corrosion while the latexes with ZnO exhibited the highest anticorrosion resistance. Furthermore, the systems with the calcium-aluminium polyphosphosilicate based pigment were superior to all the remaining systems in this respect. It is concluded that binders with nanoparticles can be used as a basis for anticorrosion coatings provided that a suitable pigment is selected. © 2019 Steinerová D. et al., published by Sciendo."

However, peroxisome proliferator activator receptor γ (PPARγ) are genetic variations that influence type 2 DM. Therefore, this study aimed at determining the genetic variation of PPARγ2 gene in DM and non-DM obsessed patients using the analytic observation and cross sectional approaches. A total of 88 patients consisting of 44 type-2DM patients and non-DM patients were used to conduct this research. Microtoise and weight scales were the instruments used to measure the body mass index, while PPARγ2 gene examination used DNA isolation method with PCR. Furthermore, the electrophoresis and results of all samples in sequencing were used to determine the effect of PPARγ2 genes and statistical tests using Chi-Square analysis. The results of statistical tests on the PPARγ2 polymorphism genotype in the DM group were found to be 100% Pro12pro, while the ala12ala and pro12ala contained no genotype. The control group found 84.1% pro12pro wild type genotype, 13.6% pro12ala and 2.3% ala12ala. BMI statistical test results obtained p = 0,000, α = 5%, therefore, there is a significant relationship between BMI in type 2 DM patients with the control group. Based on the results of the study it is concluded that the variation of PPARγ2 Pro12pro gene and body mass index obesity have a significant relationship with people living with type 2 diabetes. © 2019 Connect Journal."

Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is recommended only in patients with ongoing ischaemia because it carries a high risk of procedural complications in SCAD patients. Case summary A 51-year-old woman was admitted to our institution owing to severe chest pain. Coronary angiography showed a diffuse narrowing and radiolucent luminal flap which runs parallel to the vessel wall in the proximal left circumflex coronary artery and SCAD was diagnosed. After PCI was undertaken, optical coherence tomography disclosed a circular haematoma at the stent distal segment and an intimal tear at the distal left main coronary artery. A conservative approach was decided owing to patient stability without evidence of ongoing ischaemia and normal coronary flow. Thirty minutes later, the patient started to complain of chest pain with the ST-segment elevation in leads I, aVL, and V2-3. Coronary angiography demonstrated a total occlusion of the second diagonal brunch and double lumen morphology at the proximal-potion of left anterior descending with TIMI2 distal flow suggesting the extension of coronary dissection. Optical coherence tomography imaging revealed that the entry door of the dissection was located where the small intimal tear was found. Percutaneous coronary intervention was successfully performed, and the patient was discharged without any complication. Discussion Although the underlying mechanism of recurrent SCAD remain largely unknown, our case suggests that the residual inlet of the dissection may associate with the extension of the coronary dissection. © The Author(s) 2019.

State-of-theart SE is based upon novel parameters in addition to regional wall motion. Objective: To develop a novel software for SE data storage and reporting. Methods: We developed the prototype of a SE Comprehensive Software (SECS) with a minimum data set eventually allowing standardized collection of data. The software runs with medium-low performance computers as well as with the most popular operating systems (Windows, MAC OS and Linux). The export functions towards widely accepted formats allow easy data sharing. The software is able to generate a customized report which can be expanded in PDF and comma-separated values formats. Results: The program prototype data entry requires < 2 min per study. The main pages focus on the 5 steps of ABCDE-SE: Step A (regional wall motion); step B (B-lines with 4-site simplified scan); step C (contractile reserve with force derived from systolic blood pressure and end-systolic volume); step D (Doppler-based coronary flow velocity reserve in left anterior descending coronary artery); step E (EKG-based chronotropic reserve measured as peak/rest heart rate). The final page graphically summarizes the ABCDE information in a risk prediction model (cardiac death rate per year, from low risk < 1% to high risk > 3 %). Conclusion: SECS may provide a suitable infrastructure for an advanced clinical and research application, with simple graphic format and convenient reporting option. It may represent a trade-off between exhaustive information required by scientific standards and smooth workflow priority of busy, high volume, clinically-driven activities.

The purpose of our current study was to investigate whether selected antiviral drugs could provide antiviral activity against echovirus 30. Using RD cells, we assessed the cytopathic effect of echovirus 30, including viral RNA levels as indicators of viral replication. The effects of gemcitabine were compared to rupintrivir, a well-known antiviral drug. To understand the activity gemcitabine exerts on the viral life cycle, time course and time-of-addition assays were implemented. The most effective compounds against echovirus 30 were gemcitabine and rupintrivir, as demonstrated by their concentration-dependent activity. Gemcitabine affects the early stages of echovirus 30 infection by disrupting viral replication. However, gemcitabine failed to directly inactivate echovirus 30 particles or impede viral uptake into the RD cells. Gemcitabine can be considered as a lead candidate in the development of echovirus 30 antiviral drugs, specifically in the early stages of echovirus 30 replication. © 2019 Journal of Bacteriology and Virology."

Endocardial cardiac resynchronization therapy (eCRT), in which the left ventricular catheter is implanted in the endocardium, would be an alternative for these patients; however, its long-term outcome has not been investigated. Objectives: The aim of this study was the long-term non-invasive hemodynamic evaluation of eCRT in clinical responders. Methods: Patients implanted according to the criteria for resynchronization, using the Jurdham technique, with more than 6 months after the implant, were included in the study. All were clinical responders. The hemodynamic response was evaluated with a cardiac function analyzer, which measures the left ventricular systolic intervals (preejection and ejection periods) and automatically calculates an index of systolic function and estimates the ejection fraction (Systocor mod IS100). To assess the mechanical efficacy of eCRT, the cardiac function during biventricular mode was compared with left bundle branch block (LBBB), either spontaneous or by single stimulation of the right ventricle, with patients as their own controls. At least 20 beats were averaged in each stimulation mode and only changes >1% with p <0.01 were considered as clinically relevant and statistically significant. Results: Seventeen patients were included, with a median follow-up of 43 months, (9 to 78 months). Endocardial resynchronization, compared with LBBB ventricular activation, showed that all patients shortened the preejection period by an average of 31 ms (15%), indicative of decreased interventricular dyssynchrony caused by LBBB. In all patients, systolic function index increased by 0.3 (23%) and the EF by 8.3%. In 12/17 of cases (71%) the ejective period increased on average 8.7 ms (2.9%), suggesting an increase in systolic volume. In all changes p was < 0.01. Conclusions: Endocardial resynchronization therapy offers significant long-term hemodynamic improvement, detected by systolic intervals. © 2019, Sociedad Argentina de Cardiologia.

This study, however, is an advanced stage which focuses on testing the efficiency and efficacy of stem cell metabolites in rats (Rattus novergicus). The tests carried out examined the blood levels with ELISA instruments and integument histology by observing the activity of polymorph nuclear and monocyte cells in the control and treatment groups. In the control group, the rats were injured in the anterior and posterior back skin with a 1 × 1 cm incision wound, (only antibiotics), while the treatment group uses antibiotics and 4 mL injections of stem cell metabolites. Each group was repeated three times with the samples observed for blood levels using ELISA Interleukin-4, Interleukin-10 and Tumor Necrosis Factor-α, with integument histology at pre-injection, in days 1, 3 and 6. These were used to compare the development of inflammatory cells, polymorphonuclear and monocytes between the control and treatment groups. Stem cell metabolites are significantly effective and efficient with the ability to inhibit the inflammatory process in tissues in terms of examining the blood levels of rats using ELISA Interleukin-4, Interleukin-10 and Tumor Necrosis Factor-α. Interleukin-4 and Interleukin-10 (anti-inflammatory) tend to significantly increase the treatment group, while Tumor Necrosis Factor-α (pro-inflammation) increases the control group. Histology results showed a decrease in the activity of polymorphonuclear and monocytes inflammatory cells in the treatment group compared to the control, which indicated that the stem cell metabolites were able to significantly inhibit the inflammatory process.

Nano-structured 7YSZ electrolyte layers were fabricated by plasma spray-physical vapor deposition (PS-PVD) system. The micrograph, microstructure, mechanical properties and gas permeability were characterized by SEM, TEM, 3D X-ray CT and nano-indenter. Moreover, the deposition mechanism of PS-PVD was also discussed. Results indicate that 7YSZ electrolyte layers with a thickness of 8.7~12.3 μm were successfully prepared. The substrate temperature is a key factor to form this advanced structure controlled at ~600℃. The gas permeability of the nano-structured 7YSZ electrolyte layer can achieve 2.24×10-8~2.29×10-8 cm4•gf-1•s-1. It also shows good mechanical properties, of which the recovery rate, hardness and elastic modulus are 57%, 10 GPa and 140 GPa, respectively.

However, the spectra collected in the field must be screened before applying to hyperspectral mapping, and it is difficult to screen the field spectra quickly and efficiently. In order to rapidly and efficiently screen spectra, we propose a new screening method. In this method, we construct a comprehensive similarity evaluation model, in which local similarity and global similarity are considered synthetically, and then combined to support vector machine, which is used to set the threshold, to screen the field spectra. The method can prevent the result of computation from trapping in local or overall similarities during spectral matching, and can objectively and automatically set the threshold value for eliminating abnormal spectra. According to our experimental verifications, this method is feasible and efficient for eliminating abnormal spectral, thus it can efficiently improve recognition accuracy. This spectral analysis method can also be used in other fields for abnormal spectral elimination. © 2008-2012 IEEE."

Their payloads are usually explosive and are also known as warheads. These warheads are used to destroy a pre-set target. The aim of this paper is to optimize the values of the lift and drag forces on the given missile for better aerodynamic performance, by carrying out numerical simulations over the supersonic missile by varying the angle of attack through a set of suitable boundary conditions, while keeping the Mach number of the missile as a fixed parameter. Aerodynamic performance of the missile is studied by varying the angle of attack from 0 to 12 degrees. For every angle of attack, the coefficient of lift and coefficient of drag variations were studied in detail and were compared with the existing literature survey so as to obtain the maximum value of CL/CD ratio in order to improve the efficiency. A model of the missile was designed to-scale on Space Claim and the flow analysis was done on FLUENT standalone system using ANSYS 16 workbench. The results obtained, were in the form of flow contours of parameters such as velocity, temperature, density, pressure and turbulence. Through these flow contours the maximum and minimum values of all parameters, as well as the variation in these parameters were estimated. From the numerical analysis it was found that maximum value of CL/CD ratio was 2.5 at 12° angle of attack. It was also found that the velocity increased with increase in angle of attack and increased the efficiency. These results are advantageous upcoming to designers who aim to build aerodynamically efficient missiles. © 2019 by authors."

The filter has a notable filter capability with 10 dB bandwidth of 0.75 THz at the central frequency of 1.2 THz and incident angle insensitive range from 0° to 60°.

With the emergence of various metal precursors with high volatility, a practical way is needed to evaluate the thermal stability of metal precursors in evaporation. In this work, the thermal properties and decomposition kinetics of three precursors with different evaporation characteristics (Y(DPM)3, Cu(DPM)2, Ba(DPM)2) were comparatively investigated by non-isothermal thermogravimetric analysis, and the apparent activation energy (Ea) of evaporation process was obtained by the classic kinetic analysis methods (Ozawa, Kissinger and Friedman methods). The thermal stability of metal precursors in evaporation was evaluated through the change regulation of Ea during the heating process. The results show that the decomposition reaction of Ba(DPM)2 is indeed concomitant with its evaporation process and is highly sensitive to the change of temperature, while Y(DPM)3 and Cu(DPM)2 decompose stable. In addition, the consistent results of TGA-DSC and kinetic analysis can also confirm that evaporation kinetics study is reliable for investigating the thermostability of metal-organic compound in MOCVD process.

The rheology of blends of DAOP prepolymer initiated by 2,3-dimethyl-2,3-diphenylbutane (DMDPB) and polyphenylene oxide (PPO) was monitored during the curing process, and their thermal properties and morphology in separated phases were also studied. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) results showed that the cure degree of the reactively plasticized DAOP prepolymer was reduced with increasing PPO due to the dilution effect. The increasing amount of the DAOP prepolymer led to a gradual decrease in the viscosity of the blends and the rheology behavior was consistent with the chemical gelation of DAOP prepolymer in blends. This indicated that the addition of the DAOP prepolymer effectively improved processability. The phase separation occurring during curing of the blend and the transition from the static to dynamic mode significantly influences the development of the morphology of the blend corresponding to limited evolution of the conversion around the gel point. © 2019 by the authors."

In this paper, a novel method of steganography is approached where the cover image is scrambled using graph theory; then the secret data is embedded in the LH, HL and HH planes using LSB embedding of the cover image after applying Haar forward transform to get the embedded image. The secret data hidden in the cover image is first converted to a QR-like (Quick Response) image and then to be embedded in the cover media.

With increasing use of many-core computers that equip a large number of independent processor units, enhancing scalability and concurrency of commercial software is of crucial importance. To fulfill this demand, non-blocking implementations of the popular data structures are extensively explored both in academia and industry to effectively harness the massive parallelism in a many-core system. This paper presents a new non-blocking skip list that is not only scalable but also provides low latency even under high-concurrency pressure. Existing techniques for parallelizing skip lists rely on retrying insertion operations which fail because one thread interferes with another. This approach can introduce long-tail latency when multiple threads compete for access to the same links. We address this issue by exploiting the probabilistic nature of the skip list by allowing insertion operations to terminate after a failure, even if all the links from a node have not been updated. The resulting reduction in the heights of many nodes changes the statistical properties of the links, on which the efficiency of the skip list depends. We compensate this side-effect by recording reductions in node height and recompense for them when new nodes are created. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we implement a prototype of our low-latency non-blocking skip list, and the measurement study with various workloads shows that our skip list provides more scalable performance and lower tail latency compared to existing skip lists. © 2019, The Korean Institute of Information Scientists and Engineers."

Abdominal pain is caused by a variety of causes, so it is difficult for a triage nurse to determine the urgency of a patient, but it is still a must. The purpose of this study was to identify the related factors to the urgent diseases of patients with abdominal pain visiting ED. Methods: This study was a retrospective descriptive study. The study setting was an ED in a tertiary hospital in Korea. Data were collected from September 1, 2017 to October 15, 2017. During the study period, of a total of 6,181 patients visiting the ED, 731 complained of abdominal pain. Patients with obvious cause of pain and patients who could not express detailed symptoms were excluded. The 573 patients were included in the final analysis. We collected demographics, clinical characteristics, and final diagnosis. We divided final diagnoses into urgent diseases which were more likely to be life-threatening without treatment and non-urgent diseases. We identified the related factors to the urgent diseases of patients with abdominal pain using the logistic regression. Results: 173 (30.2%) patients had urgent diseases. Age (OR=1.02, 95% CI=1.00~1.03), referral from other clinics (OR=2.92, 95% CI= 1.86~4.60), ambulance utilization (OR=2.00, 95% CI=1.27~3.15), diarrhea (OR=0.44, 95% CI=0.25~0.76), and tachycardia (OR=2.27, 95% CI=1.44~3.58) were related to urgent diseases. Conclusion: Triage nurse should take into account the patient's age, mode of visiting, and route of visiting ED; and check the symptom of tachycardia or diarrhea. © 2019 Korean Academy of Community Health Nursing."

The strength of these mesodefects increases with deformation and, as a result, they create non-uniform elastic stress fields, which significantly affect the processes of structure formation, strain hardening and material’s fracture. In the present work, the interaction of a slip band propagating in a grain body under the action of an external stress field with an elastic field of wedge disclination is investigated by the discrete dislocation dynamics simulation method. The simulation results show that the behavior of the front of the band has common regularities. For a given distance between the slip band and the disclination y0, the behavior of the dislocation cluster in the front of the band essentially depends on the distance between the slip planes of the dislocations h. For small h, it is similar to the behavior of a dislocation pile-up. However, the maximum density of dislocations occurs not in the head of the cluster, as in the classical blocked dislocation pile-up, but in its central part. An increase in the distance h between dislocations slip planes leads to a “splitting” of the front of the band. For larger h the front of the band transforms into a broken from both sides dislocation wall. The minimal distance hc, above which such dislocation wall is formed, depends on the disclination strength ω0 and the distance y0. The maximal misorientation of the wall is equal to the disclination strength ω0 at y0 = 0. With an increase in the external stress, the wall overcomes the force barrier of the disclination and moves as a whole to the lateral surface of the crystal.

In this study, the characteristics of the pendubot are first reviewed; each part is then designed using Solidworks by dividing the pendubot into three parts: the base frame, first link frame, and second link frame. These three parts are then imported into the Simulink environment via a STEP file format, which is the standard protocol used in data exchange between CAD applications. A 3D model of the pendubot is then constructed using Simscape, and the usefulness of the 3D model is validated by a comparison with a dynamic equation derived using the Lagrangian formulation. A linearized model around an upright equilibrium position is finally obtained, and a sliding mode controller is designed based on the linear quadratic regulator. Simulation results showed that the designed controller effectively maintained upright balance of the pendubot in the presence of disturbance. © The Korea Institute of Information and Communication Engineering."

However, the activity of WSN is totally dependent on the energy resource available with each and every node of the network. Thus to prolong the activity period of WSN, it is necessary to utilize the available energy systematically. This aim is well satisfied by the design of hierarchical clustering protocol. This article highlights the mechanism to balance the energy consumption (load balancing) inside WSN. Proposed protocol design follows energy aware heterogeneous network model and modified scheme of cluster head (CH) selection. Secondly, maintain the record for nodes utilized in the role of CH and its capability. Proposed approach explores energy utilization by rotating CH selection, and reduces the internal overheads in network management. Through this approach, we are able to improve the energy efficiency of WSN by clustering multilevel nodes. In this design, CH is selected based on node energy and relative distance attributes. Proposed protocol is simulated and validated with reference to energy based performance parameters. It's been noted that proposed implementation outperforms the existing protocols in terms of stability period, residual energy, and lifetime of the network. © 2019 by authors, all rights reserved."

There are cases where main high voltage contactor has tripped and disabled the process at satellite platforms due to the lightings module grounded. This is unacceptable to the daily production. In this paper it will discuss on the electrical distribution load flow analysis, capacitive charging system for the HRG designs and the single phase to ground fault control which is offered by the HRG systems. In the oil and gas platform, there is always a case where the ground fault occurs and causes disturbance to the process. With the 3 Generators (Solar Centaur 3125 MVA) power for the overall electrical distribution, all the equipment on the buses is prone to the faults. It has always been the challenge to control and eliminate or reduce the ground faults. The determination of the total system charging current (Ic) is important and thus determining the value of resistor that is able to limit the fault to ground. The limit of current is about 5-10A.

NMR measurement is lithology-independent as the only source of the measured signal is from the pore fluids. As the pore fluids interact with rock surfaces, the rock matrix influences the fluid response and complicate the data interpretation. In this regard, two phenomena, namely internal gradients and restricted diffusion, come into the picture. In porous media, contrast in the magnetic susceptibility of rock grains and pore fluids might lead to significant magnetic-field inhomogeneities. The internal gradients resulting from these local field heterogeneities can cause further reduction in T2 relaxation times as well as the T2 cutoff. Under specific conditions, more precisely, in a free-diffusion regime, internal magnetic-field gradients can be calculated from the increase in the transverse relaxation rate of pore fluids with increasing interecho time. A comprehensive NMR study was carried out on two distinct formations/pays from two different basins located in the eastern and western parts of India, namely, low-resistivity, low-contrast (LRLC) pay of the Tipam formation (Charali field, Assam and Assam Arakan basin) and the Chhatral pay of the Cambay shale formation (Gamij field, Cambay basin). The influence of magnetically susceptible material on NMR T2 relaxation and hence, on T2 cutoffs, has been analyzed. We studied echo-spacing dependence on the diffusion component of transverse relaxation and could observe different asymptotic relaxation regimes. In the present study, T1/T2 2D laboratory data have also been acquired and T1/T2 ratios have been studied alongside the echo-spacing dependence ofT2 relaxation. In two presented case studies, although we have contrasting permeability ranges (poor in one set/field to moderate/high in other), we obtained perceptibly low T2 cutoff values (compared to a default 33-ms T2 cutoff) for both cases. Our study shows the presence of an internal field gradient, which in turn indicates a magnetic susceptibility contrast between pore-filling fluids and rock matrix. The presence of paramagnetic minerals is one of the factors in lowering the T2 cutoff values that has also been reported in mineralogical studies. The observed range of T1/T2 ratios indicates the presence of varying size, susceptibility, concentration and distribution of magnetically susceptible sites as well as different orders of grain sizes. © 2019 Society of Well Log Analystists Inc..

On 18 April 2014 an Ms7.2 earthquake occurred near our Petatlan station. Our study shows two notable anomalies observed in the behavior of the Fourier power spectrum of ΔV for ultra low frequency ULF-range, and the transition of the αl-exponent of the detrended fluctuation analysis of the ΔV time series from uncorrelated to correlated signals. These anomalies lasted approximately three and a half months before the main shock. We compare this electric pattern with another electric signal we reported associated with an Ms7.4 that occurred on 14 September 1995 at Guerrero state, Mexico.

The Firefly Algorithm (FA) which is a type of meta-heuristic algorithm is inspired by the blinking or flashing behaviour of fireflies that is embedded into Artificial Immune System (AIS) algorithm. The aim of this study is to develop the AISFA algorithm in order to improve the voltage profile and minimize losses of distribution system between the different operational strategy and types of DG. The types of DG include DG type 1, DG type 2, and DG type 3. The proposed technique was verified on IEEE 69-bus test system and the program was developed using the MATLAB programming software. The results showed a significant loss reduction in the line losses and voltage profile improvement has been obtained for optimal DG capacity and operational strategy in distribution system. From the simulation, the results were recorded in terms of the total losses and minimum voltage for the system. The results of the optimisation process of DG are utilized for the assistance of power system operators and planners.

Furthermore, automatic electrical characterization of the identified flakes was performed. The proposed micro-robotic automation sequence consists of three main steps. To start, a sample surface plane is calculated, based on multiple foci points across the substrate. Secondly, flakes on the substrate are identified in the hue, saturation, and value (HSV) color space, with an implementation to fit the measurement probe, used to avoid undersized samples and adjust the flake orientation. Finally, electrical characterization is performed based on four point probe measurements with the Van der Pauw method.

This island ranks among areas with low water resources, which at the present time are allocated. In order to create the prospect of increased groundwater resources, a concept has been developed that allows for the recovery of part of the freshwater from drainage systems which discharge into the waters of Szczecin Lagoon or the River Świna. The present article discusses the secondary use of water from drainage systems for supply of the Wydrzany resource area. The notion of using water from the White Bridge pumping station was considered the most promising. The catchment area of the polder is 880 ha, 280 ha of which are located on Polish territory. The White Bridge pumping station transfers water from the polder, which it leads to the Peat Channel which, in turn, drains water gravitationally into Szczecin Lagoon. Here, results of simulations aimed at the use of drainage water to improve upon groundwater resources in the ""Wydrzany"" intake are discussed. On the basis of these simulations of artificial water supply to the intake, an increase of available resources by up to 50 per cent may be expected. © 2019 Ryszard Hoc et al., published by Sciendo 2019."

At the same time, the purchase of weapons by the population for individual security purposes is not so unambiguous. On the one hand, law-abiding citizens have the right to protect their lives and health from criminal threats. On the other hand, a free turnover of a large number of weapons increases their accessibility and the possibility of getting hold by individuals who are able to use them for criminal purposes.

The purpose of this study was to provide information on medication errors, understanding the legal protection of patients after a negative effect and loss, as well as the role of pharmacy and health workers regarding drug prescriptions in hospitals. The results encompassed the forms of criminal, civil and administrative responsibility from pharmacists, nurses, and doctors except for delegate nurses. It further revealed that standard operating procedures are needed, either on drugs or more comprehensive doctor delegation actions, to reduce errors in prescriptions in hospitals. The focus should, therefore, be more on nursing and pharmacist laws. Additionally, provision of training to the various staff members in the hospitals is much necessary as it can increase their learning capabilities and dealing with the drugs in more responsible way.

The imaging characteristics of the toroidal mirrors used in the system, optical design and parameter optimization, aberrations and tolerance analysis of the system and alignment were studied. Firstly, based on the requirements of plasma diagnosis, some optical system parameters were determined, and the the microscope for imaging the X-ray through the basic structure of two tandem toroidal mirrors in u-shaped arrangement and one planar mirror for spectrum selection was designed. The structural parameters of the three mirrors were preliminarily determined according to the anastigmatic focusing. Then the optical design software was used for modeling and optimization. The spherical aberration, coma aberration, field obliquity and astigmatism of X-ray microscope were also analyzed. By analyzing the influence of system parameters change on the image quality and the accuracy requirement of the system, reasonable tolerance was established. Finally, An auxiliary aiming system was designed to solve the off-axis problem of grazing incidence mounting of the toroid mirrors when adjusted offline, also a bidirectional binocular intersection online aiming system was designed to solve the problem of assembling and aiming accuracy of the system. Experiment results show that the resolution of the microscope is less than 5 μm at 500 μm field of view, which basically meets the requirements of large field of view and high resolution in laser plasma hard X-ray imaging. © 2019, Science Press.

This study was, therefore, conducted as a result of the need to add leather as supplementary material to the traditional materials such as clay, metal, wood and half-gourd used for producing vessels in Ghana. The purpose of the study was to find out how Ghanaian indigenous leather could be used in the production of leather vessels. The qualitative study employed three key techniques, namely: 'Cuir bouilli' leather hardening methods, the sand pounding technique, and assemblage and construction technique. Based on the results, the baking and hot wax methods adversely affected the indigenous leather positively in the hardening of the leather. The results also show that using only one part of the leather (the back, belly or butt) affected the quality of the leather vessels, but incorporating the various parts of the hide helped improve the quality and durability of the leather vessels. The implications of the results and future research directions are also presented. This study has, therefore, expanded the usefulness of the Ghanaian indigenous vegetable tanned leather apart from the conventional usage for making shoes, bags and belts. © 2019 American Leather Chemists Association.

Such a change in kinetic properties can be due to the reverse conversion of generated magnetic energy into kinetic energy. We model the reverse conversion process using the classical Kazantsev model, which describes the operation of a small-scale dynamo in a mirror-symmetric turbulent flow. Our results suggest that the appearance of magnetic energy at small scales in the kinetic spectrum can stop the generation process. This stabilization turns out to be no less efficient than the braking of a turbulent dynamo through the conservation of total magnetic and kinetic energies. However, it looks more realistic, because for most dynamo systems the observed magnetic energy is lower than the kinetic one by several orders of magnitude. We show that in this method of nonlinear suppression just the appearance of energy at small scales is often not enough; in particular, a simple shift of the Gaussian spectrum toward small scales only amplifies the generation. In this paper, we describe a reasonable spectrum transformation method that allows the generation in both critical and supercritical regimes of small-scale dynamo operation to be stabilized. The fact that the described spectrum transformation can be directly recorded in an experimental test is equally important. © 2019, Pleiades Publishing, Inc."

A Full Factorial Design (FFD) with Response Surface Methodology (RSM) is employed to establish, optimize and to investigate the relationships of three laser transformation hardening process parameters such as laser power, scanning speed, and focused position on laser hardened bead profile parameters such as hardened bead width, hardened depth, heat input and power density. In this work, Laser Transformation Hardening (LTH) with high precision and an optimum desired minimum value of hardened depth of 241 microns has been accomplished with heat input = 150 J/cm and power density = 294.08 W/mm2 for the laser process parameters of lower beam power: 750 Watts, high scanning speed: 3000 mm/min and a defocused beam of –30 mm. Effects of laser process parameters on laser hardened bead geometries were carried out using RSM. Results indicate that the scanning speed has a positive effect on all hardened bead dimensions while the laser power has a positive effect particularly on hardened bead width as compared to hardened depth and heat input. The optimum laser hardening conditions are identified sequentially to minimise hardened depth, heat input, power density and maximum hardened bead width. The validation results demonstrate that the developed models are accurate with low percentages of error. © 2019, Informatics Publishing Limited & Indian Society for Surface Science and Technology.

We aimed to determine the characteristics of neonates with sepsis and etiological organisms in a single center. Material and Methods: This retrospective study included neonates admitted at level I-III units (NICU) in Kanuni Sultan Suleyman Training and Research Hospital during a one-year period (January 1st, 2010 to December 31st, 2010). The characteristics of neonates diagnosed as sepsis were compared to those without sepsis in order to determine risk factors. The distribution and resistance pattern of pathogens causing sepsis during 2010 were identified and compared with those of the previous years. Results: Among the 4703 patients treated in our NICU, 292 (6.2%) were diagnosed as culture proven sepsis [96 early-onset sepsis (EOS), 196 late-onset sepsis (LOS)]. Mean birth weight was 2304 ± 1066.9 g (640-5250 g) and mean gestational age was 36 ± 4.2 weeks (24-40 weeks). Preterm babies were infected four times more frequently than babies born at term [OR, 3.96 (95% CI, 3.10-5.06, p= 0.001)]. Presence of central venous catheter, ventilation support, total parenteral nutrition, and prolonged hospitalization were other risk factors for sepsis development. Mortality from EOS was higher than that from LOS (19.8% vs. 4.1%, p= 0.001). Coagulase negative staphylococci (CoNS) were the most commonly isolated pathogens in blood cultures of term neonates. Gram-negative bacilli [Klebsiella pneumoniae (18.4%), other GNB (27%)] were more common in preterm babies than term neonates. Resistance to penicillin and ampicillin were high in gram-positive bacteria. Ampicillin, gentamicin, cefotaxime, and carbapenem resistances in GNB were 63%, 36%, 33%, and 7.5%, respectively. Conclusion: Prematurity is a major risk factor for sepsis. During the years of 1997, 2005, 2007, and 2010, CoNS remained the most frequent pathogen. The relative proportion of gram-negative bacilli is substantial in preterm babies. Carbapenem resistance in GNB is worth consideration. ©Copyright 2019 by Pediatric Infectious Diseases and Immunization Society."

For this reason, the microscopic stress and strain in soft primary α (αp) and hard transformed β matrix (βt) were quantitatively analyzed by a microstructure-based finite element model to determine their effect on strength and ductility of Ti-6Al-2Zr-1Mo-1V alloy. The results show that microscopic stress in both αp and βt shows a normal distribution. The peak stress and stress peak height of βt are much larger than those of αp. While, αp has large peak strain and βt has large strain peak height. As αp volume fraction decreases from 49% to 12%, the contribution of βt to ultimate tensile strength (UTS) and failure strain (FS) of the alloy increases from 59% to 91% and 36% to 75%, respectively. However, as the contribution of βt increases, UTS of the alloy increases by 17% and FS decreases by 21%.

Where in the case of transnational companies we can most often observe trade expansion with the pushing out of the competitors working on the local market, the pattern more characteristic of metacorporations is merger and acquisition (MAA) where the management of the holding (as a rule) signs contracts with local manufacturers increasing their production capacity at the expense of local productions and businesses. The aim of this paper is to track the dynamics of international business development in the conditions of globalization and find out which regions and spheres of business are currently considered the most preferable for foreign investment. The results gained can be used in planning of perspective outlet markets and in search of new collaboration objects. The novelty of this paper lies in the observed character of interdependence of national economies and redistribution of investment flows between regions. The conclusions were made, that foreign investment flows (FIF) significantly influence the development of business inside the country: businesses with foreign capital receive a number of benefits compared to local companies. © 2019 General Jonas Zemaitis Military Academy of Lithuania."

In this article we treat it as a semiotic code - that is to say, a shared assumption - and argue that democratic theory enables people to think and talk about the idea(s) of democracy. Furthermore, the application of this specific code is highly political. For one, it is embedded in concrete contexts and discourses and used in arguments and narratives. In addition, the application of democratic theory has also substantial consequences on the lives of people. We illustrate this argument by reflecting briefly on Abraham Lincoln's ""Gettysburg Address"" and its recodification and consequences in different contexts. © Berghahn Journals."

To help understand why, it is very important to study the coexistence of corporate social responsibility (CSR) and corporate social irresponsibility (CSI). This paper considers a manufacturer with irresponsibility risk in a centralized and decentralized socially responsible supply chain, and uses a Stackelberg game to investigate the optimal policies on price and CSR investment level. This paper also examines the influence of consumer responsibility awareness and CSR investment efficiency on the decision behaviors of the manufacturer and retailer. Moreover, we developed a new mechanism to coordinate the decentralized supply chain system, which consists of the retailer participating in CSR and revenue sharing. Our results indicate that the manufacturer's and retailer's optimal decisions may not be significantly influenced by consumer responsibility awareness, but the effect of CSR investment efficiency is significant. Our results also show that if the degree of retailer participation and the proportion of revenue sharing are of moderate size, then not only can the contract mechanism coordinate the decentralized socially responsible supply chain, but it can ensure that a win-win situation can be achieved by the supply chain members. © 2019 by the authors."

One of the main reasons for speech quality decrease during the surgical treatment of vocal tract diseases is the loss of the vocal tract's parts and the disruption of its symmetry. In particular, one of the most common oncological diseases of the oral cavity is cancer of the tongue. During surgical treatment, a glossectomy is performed, which leads to the need for speech rehabilitation to eliminate the occurring speech defects, leading to a decrease in speech intelligibility. In this paper, we present an automated approach for conducting the speech quality evaluation. The approach relies on a convolutional neural network (CNN). The main idea of the approach is to train an individual neural network for a patient before having an operation to recognize typical sounding of phonemes for their speech. The neural network will thereby be able to evaluate the similarity between the patient's speech before and after the surgery. The recognition based on the full phoneme set and the recognition by groups of phonemes were considered. The correspondence of assessments obtained through the autorecognition approach with those from the human-based approach is shown. The automated approach is principally applicable to defining boundaries between phonemes. The paper shows that iterative training of the neural network and continuous updating of the training dataset gradually improve the ability of the CNN to define boundaries between different phonemes. © 2019 by the authors."

Along these lines, for further comprehension of the field's theory, universities should take the lead in developing equipment for hands-on practical training. Several converter trainer kits exist in the market from many companies. A review of previous designs gives adequate ideas on the basics of the trainer and the components used in the trainer. The higher number of components used in the trainer significantly increases the cost, size and complexity of the system. Therefore, this paper outlines the design and development of a DC/DC converter trainer with buck and boost configurations. The proposed 2-in-1 DC/DC converter trainer can be configured as buck or boost at a time. The DC/DC converter comprises identical components but with different circuit configuration and operation. The circuit parameters are first calculated. To verify the effectiveness and functionality of the proposed trainer, a prototype is tested and compared with the simulation results from MATLAB/Simulink software. The proposed trainer uses Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) to generate the Pulse-Width Modulation (PWM) signals. The findings obtained show that both theoretical simulation and experimental results align with each other. The results show that the proposed trainer can be designed with identical parameter components under certain constraints and conditions. © 2019 by authors."

In particular, n-alkanes are widely occurring in the oil, soil pollution, and chemical industries, yet there is little knowledge on the effects of molecular chain length on the contact line movement. Here, we studied the effects of molecular chain length on the contact line movement in water/n-alkane/solid systems with different surface wettabilities. We used n-heptane (C7), n-decane (C10), and n-hexadecane (C16) as alkanes and ±-quartz as the solid surface. We calculated the time-variation contact line moving velocity and also analyzed the jump frequency and the mean distance of the molecular displacement occurring within the contact line zone by molecular-kinetic theory. Molecular dynamics simulation results show that the contact line velocity decreases with increasing the chain length, originally caused by the decreasing the jump frequency and mean distance. These variations with the molecular chain length are related to the more torsions and deformations of the molecules with a longer chain length. In addition, the moving mechanism of the contact line on the same solid surface does not change at different molecular chain lengths, implying that the moving mechanism mainly depends on the three-phase wettability. © 2019 by the authors.

However, a weak point is that in Poland only one element of the water cycle, precipitation, is sampled and measured over more than 312 thousands km2 at a single station. It is therefore necessary to seek extension of or alternatives for these rare data. Such an alternative is the sampling of groundwater containing tritium in the national monitoring network of groundwater bodies that is maintained by the Polish Geological Institute. Based on such data we have constructed δ18O and δD isoscapes (i.e., maps of δ18O and δD values) of recent groundwater.

Pharyngitis due to group A Streptococcus (GAS) is a common pediatric infection. Physicians might diagnose GAS pharyngitis more accurately when given biosurveillance information about GAS activity. The availability of geographic GAS testing data may be able to assist with real-time clinical decision-making for children with throat infections. Methods. GAS rapid antigen testing data were obtained from the records of 6086 children at Boston Children’s Hospital and 8648 children at Duke University Medical Center. Records included children tested in outpatient, primary care settings. We constructed Bayesian generalized additive models, in which the outcome variable was the binary result of GAS testing, and predictor variables included smoothed functions of patient location data and both cyclic and longitudinal time data. Results. We observed a small degree of geographic heterogeneity, but no convincing clusters of high risk. The probability of a positive test declined during the summer months. Conclusions. Future work should include geographic data about school catchments to identify whether GAS transmission clusters within schools. © The Author(s) 2019."

She proposes the word “mafiacraft” to conceptualize this process, evoking anthropological analyses of efforts to criminalize witches. The analogy dramatizes how much violence has occurred in modern Sicily without either prosecutors or morally sensitive Sicilians being able to identify, much less agree upon, those responsible. Puccio-Den acknowledges that “historical and political conditions” influence turning points in the ability of both sets of actors to concretize responsibility (“responsibilize,” as she puts it).

Therefore, the demand for pharmacometrics (PMx) consultancy services increased. Higher quality service suitable for regulatory submission and out-licensing deals were desired. In this analysis, we compiled and summarized 3 years of experiences of Q-fitter, the first PMx consultancy service company providing PMx analysis to the pharmaceutical industry in Korea. The projects were organized by companies, company types, indications, therapeutic areas, drug development stages, purposes, and scope of services. Within each category, we subcategorized the sections and assessed proportions and a year-over-year trend. As a result, we observed an increase in the number of projects in an average of ~170% per year, with the most frequent types of companies collaborated being the domestic pharmaceutical companies. Among the projects, ~72% involved modeling and simulation using population pharmacokinetic (PK) models, and the other included non-compartmental analysis (NCA), drug-drug interaction (DDI) prediction, and interpretation of the modeling results. The most sought-after purpose in PMx analysis was first-in-human (FIH) dose prediction followed by PK analysis, next clinical trial prediction, and scenario-based simulation. Oncology has been the top therapeutic area of interest every year consisting of ~38% of total projects, followed by Neurology (~13%).

The contrast sensitivity of visual images through Fresnel microprisms was investigated. An imaging system for stroke test objects through Fresnel microprisms was set up. Experimental data on contract were obtained using new electronic method for registering the resolution of test stroke images. The experimental data obtained by the imaging system is consistent with the visual acuity data obtained by the traditional optotype test method. It was stated that applying microprisms noticeably reduce the contrast of test stroke optotypes which is diminishing proportionally to the prism strength and to the initial contrast value of the optotypes. The main reason for the reducing of the contrast and for the worsening of the resolution of optical images when using prisms is the white light chromatism and the diffraction of light beams at the microrelief of microprisms with different prismatic strength. The practical ways for the diminishing effect of reducing the contrast of the test optotypes are proposed by adopting the neutral glass filters with a sprayed layer of chromium. © 2019, Science Press.

The third method used excitonic band gap theory for Ga1-xInxAs alloy temperature dependence by considering Passler fitting (p) and average phonon temperature (θ). Results depict that optimum nitrogen fraction was in the range of 0.012 to 0.018% to achieve the device response at 1.3 μm wavelength, with an energy band gap in range of 0.955 ± 0.005 eV.

The findings imply that a new policy frame, formed on the Kangsong Taeguk doctrine, has been applied to recent policy changes since 2012 in North Korea in order for reforms to be stably instituted. © 2019 by INSTITUTE OF KOREAN STUDIES."
"An Aluminum–Magnesium Variety of Caryopilite from Goethite–Neotocite–Rhodochrosite Ores of the Mazul Manganese Deposit, Krasnoyarsk Krai","2019","Geology of Ore Deposits","0","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85079118739&doi=10.1134%2fS1075701519080026&partnerID=40&md5=07f090c4782ca4d40f83cd7a56bcb4fe","Abstract: A variety of caryopilite enriched in Mg and Al from the goethite–neotocite–rhodochrosite ores of the Mazul manganese deposit in Krasnoyarsk Krai is described. The mineral occurs as sheaf-like and fibrous aggregates of fine-lamellar individuals intimately intergrown with goethite, hematite, rhodochrosite, and neotocite. The optical parameters of caryopilite are: Z = yellow, X = pale yellow, β ≈ 1.60, γ – α ≈ 0.010 – 0.015, and parallel extinction. The average chemical composition corresponds to the empirical formula (Mn1.95Mg1.61Fe2+ 0.63A10.58◻0.23)5.00[(Si3.88Al0.12)4.00O10](OH)6, where ◻ is vacancy. The unusually high Mg concentration and elevated Al content allow identification of a new aluminum–magnesium variety of caryopilite. It replaces sedimentary neotocite at low temperatures. It is suggested that at increasing temperature this variety of caryopilite loses Mg and Al, which incorporate into Mg–Mn chlorite and spessartine. © 2019, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd."
"Explant-like passaging of cells growing on portable substrata permits the avoidance of enzyme application and facilitates the passage procedure","2019","Folia Biologica (Poland)","0","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85079275529&doi=10.3409%2ffb_67-4.17&partnerID=40&md5=0d006c1cd1414d304c286e239515373e","The experiments presented in this paper show how growing cells on portable substrats can be useful to facilitate and accelerate the passaging (subculture) of anchorage-dependent cells. Experiments have shown that portable substrats are cheap, commercially available, and transparent. They are easily cut into various shapes and sizes, and are easy to sterilize. Portable substrats are also friendly to cells and permit faster than usual cell passaging procedures. Anchorage-dependent cells growing on the bottom of a culture vessel made of glass or polystyrene can be quickly passaged with previously-cut small fragments of glass fiber or nylon meshes or small fragments of polyester foil as well as nylon fishing lines and biodegradable surgeon threads that have been inserted into the vessel. The surfaces of such fragments of portable supports are quickly overgrown with cells and can be easily transferred to a new culture vessel. As with tissue explants, cells migrate and grow over the bottom of the new culture vessels. Using cell viability tests, analyses of proliferation and fluorescence microscopy,we confirmed the utility of the investigated substrats for cell culture. In addition, the passaging cells, together with a portable support (like explants), eliminate the need for an application of proteolytic enzymes which modify numerous cell properties and activities and would keep the cell from detaching from the substratum which would lead to the cell rounding and changes in the cell's cytoskeleton architecture. © Institute of Systematics and Evolution of Animals."

Despite the fact that an applied magnetic field acts directly on only the nanoparticles, structural and mechanical changes occur throughout the entire composite system due to the coupling between these particles and the polymer. The study of these changes is important in view of widely discussed prospects of using MFGs as field-controlled microcontainers for delivering bioactive substances or drugs. In this work, a. numerical model is proposed and realized, which enables one to perform a. detailed analysis of stationary states of an MFG suspended in a. neutral solvent. The effect of concentration of particles and their magnetic characteristics (magnetic moment magnitude, degree of uniaxial magnetic anisotropy, and interparticle dipolar coupling parameter) on the structure formation in the absence of an external magnetic field and under its influence is investigated. It is shown that the chain-like clusters are in fact the only type of aggregates arising in MFG. However, their effect on the polymer subsystem depends strongly on the type of magnetic anisotropy and on the magnetic phase concentration. This, in turn, entails different scenarios of the mechanical response of MFG and, in particular, differently affects the change in the amount of solvent present in the sample. © 2019, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd."
"Decomposition Kinetics of Metastable β Phase in Ti-1300 Alloy Under Isothermal Conditions; [等温条件下Ti-1300合金亚稳β相的分解动力学]","2019","Xiyou Jinshu Cailiao Yu Gongcheng/Rare Metal Materials and Engineering","0","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85079324918&partnerID=40&md5=6063c613420e2cf36a28deaa81731cb5","Phase transformation kinetics of Ti-1300 alloy after solution treatment were investigated under isothermal conditions in the temperature range of 400℃ to 700℃ by dilatometric method. The decomposition kinetic equation of metastable β phase in the alloy was constructed under isothermal conditions by analyzing the experimental data in the theoretical frame of the Johnson-Mehl-Avrami (JMA) theory. The different values of K and n parameters were obtained in the temperature range of 400℃ to 420℃ and 500℃ to 700℃, indicating that the mechanism of the phase transformation is different in different temperature ranges. The decomposition mechanism of metastable β phase is βm→β'+β→α+β at the temperature of 400℃ to 420℃, whereas the decomposition mechanism of metastable β phase is βm→α+β at the temperature of 500℃ to 700℃. When the metastable β phase of Ti-1300 alloy was annealed isothermally at a given temperature, the amount of α phase increases firstly, and then reaches a stable value with increasing the holding time. Based on calculation and experimental results, time-temperature-transformation diagrams (TTT diagram) of Ti-1300 alloys were plotted for the metastable β phase decomposition under isothermal conditions from 500℃ to 700℃. And the nose temperature of the TTT diagram of the alloy is around 600℃ for the Ti-1300 alloys. Copyright © 2019, Northwest Institute for Nonferrous Metal Research. Published by Elsevier BV.

"Efficacy of a motorized air support to prevent pressure ulcers in at-risk patients hospitalized in rehabilitation departments: Incidence and prevalence studies","2019","Panminerva Medica","0","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85079202098&doi=10.23736%2fS0031-0808.18.03592-9&partnerID=40&md5=a722d031116fa6f991060141219d4b6b","BACKGROUND: The main objective was to assess the reduction of the pressure ulcers prevalence which could be obtained if Ascalis Optimo® mattresses were made available ad libitum in rehabilitation services (RS) by comparison to prevalence as observed in the national PERSE study (historical control) in similar departments using a variety of prevention aids. METHODS: This cross-sectional prevalence study was combined with a prospective study of the incidence of pressure ulcer occurrence in the high-risk target population whose beds were systematically equipped with the studied support. RESULTS: The prevalence study shows that 12 of the 369 patients presented pressure ulcers which occurred when Ascalis Optimo® was used. It corresponds to a prevalence of 3.3% [1.4, 5.1] which is significantly lower than those recorded in the PERSE Study: 11.8% [10.8; 12.8] P<0.0001. The ulcer incidence study was conducted on 71 patients hospitalized on a bed with an Ascalis Optimo® support because of their high risk of pressure ulcers. When taking into account all pressure ulcers' stages and locations, 6 patients had a pressure ulcer corresponding to an incidence of 8.5% [3.2; 17.5]. When taking into account, only stages 2 to 4 as generally done in literature, 2 patients had a pressure ulcer i.e. an incidence of 2.8% [0.0; 6.7]. CONCLUSIONS: The significant decrease of the prevalence of pressure ulcer in the rehabilitation departments where Ascalis Optimo® were available when compared to the current prevalence observed in rehabilitation services and moreover the results of the study of pressure ulcer incidence in patients bedridden on Ascalis Optimo®, shows the benefit provided to patients in terms of pressure ulcers prevention. © 2018 EDIZIONI MINERVA MEDICA."
